8691158	b' I am making an ajax call to a php file on my server.  \n\n That php file retrieves some info from various websites, so an ajax call can take 30 seconds to complete in the worst case.  \n\n All I want to do is to set a timeout value for the ajax call and to trigger a function when timeout is reached.  \n\n I think jQuery .complete is what I am looking for since it is called in any case but how to detect if it is called on timeout? \n'

This DLL needs to work  with one is  SimpleShareMem  or\n ShareMem  or without  memory managers. This DLL needs to be callable from foreign\nlanguages such as VB, C++, and C#. \n\n By default, strings should now be Unicode strings. Should we use\nEmbarcadero to work with these strings? \n\n Strings are either: (a) single-byte characters that do not support Unicode\nor (b) wide strings, where each character requires two bytes. (These do\nsupport Unicode, but they are not UTF-8 strings.) \n\n There are two pointer types available:  PAnsiChar  and  PWideChar  (there\nis no  PUnicodeChar  pointer available).  PChar  is an alias for\n PWideChar  -- does this means we always need to allocate  2 * length \namount of memory for these strings? (And, similarly, do we need to divide\nthe memory by  2  to get the length of these strings?) \n\n For string constants, do we need to mark the type of the string in the\nsource code?

How should\nwe include the BOM in our strings? \n\n How should we work with ANSI strings in different Windows Code Pages? If\nwe receive an ANSI string with code page 1200, should we re-code the\nstring or work with it as-is? \n\n How should we use the  TEncoding  class to convert between Unicode, UTF-8,\nWideString, and AnsiString classes? \n\n Are there any severe performance penalties using wide strings or Unicode\nstrings? \n\n Should we write our interfaces to require working with only the WideString\nvariants when using the general memory manager? \n\n Should we write our interfaces to require length parameters for  PChar ,\n PAnsiChar , and  PWideChar  parameter types? \n\n How do write our interfaces to determine if a file is stored in Unicode,\nUTF-8, ANSI, or Wide Characters?

8691393	b' Basic things you need to know if you don\'t want to read the long specs: \n\n Computers communicate on the internet using multiple protocol  layers  (like in an onion). The top layer is called an application layer; in the case of a browser and a web server, that protocol is called HTTP. It describes headers and response codes and such.  \n\n Underneath that protocol, there\'s a transport protocol called TCP that ensures that the packets sent over the Internet all arrive properly, and in the correct order. Underneath that, there\'s a routing protocol called IP that makes sure that the packets on the internet - flowing through a bunch of intermediary computers - do get to the destination.  \n\n Each of these layers has its own specifications, packet headers, and so forth. The HTTP packet is wrapped inside a TCP packet, and all that magic is wrapped inside an IP packet.  \n\n There are several other layers involved (google "OSI model" if you want details), but this should give you a starting point.  \n'

I have done some research and I found 2 frameworks which are PhoneGap and Mono(touch and droid). \n\n \n PhoneGap seems to be slow. \n Mono need two code base for 2 platforms, only the libraries can be\nshared (correct me if I am wrong).

8691696	b' I\'m looking for the most optimized way to have an object in JS; since JS allows you to do something in multiple ways I want to know which is considered to be "best practice". \n\n A conceptual use of the object would be this: \n\n \n\n I have some examples here: \n\n Example #1: \n\n \n\n Here I actually have no properties; "name" cannot be changed or be read by public and getName method can be accessed public and invoke with local name variable.

I\'m just not sure about the difference between  var method = function () {};  and  function method() {};  from a functional and performance perspective. \n\n Example #3: \n\n \n\n Here I have name property which can be read/write by public and I also have a prototype getName method that can be accessed public. \n\n Example #4: \n\n \n\n Here I have what I had in example #3 with the difference that I make sure that prototype methods are set only once and only when required. \n\n So the end question is, which of those you will suggest me to follow or if any of them then which way is the best practice? \n'

8691738	b' For what you want, the best way is probably this: \n\n \n\n Why is this? Well, first of all, encapsulation. If possible, you generally want to put the function in the prototype, like so: \n\n \n\n  However!  In this case, it appears you don\'t want  Person.name  to be accessible. For that reason, you need to use closures. \n\n As for this method: \n\n \n\n That\'s not good. You publicly expose  this.name , so it offers no advantage over the previous prototype method, but you continually overwrite  Person.prototype.getName  with the same function. There\'s no point in doing that;  this  will be the appropriate object every time. What\'s more,  Person.prototype.getName  won\'t be accessible until the first  Person  object is instantiated so there\'s not much point in making it "public" in the first place. Your fourth example is basically identical, with more cruft making it harder to understand, but it still has all the disadvantages. \n\n So, in this case, go with the first version; when possible, though, set methods on  prototype  so they can be called outside of an instance. \n\n Finally, I would recommend using: \n\n \n\n over \n\n \n\n because 1) The second example is missing a semicolon, 2) the  var  implies that the constructor is variable which it should not be, and 3) I don\'t believe JDoc allows  @constructor  to be applied to it, causing a warning in Closure Compiler at least 1 . \n\n \n\n   1  Okay, not so important.

8691811	b" Sounds like you need a data queue (buffer) for each connected client.  Each time data comes in on the port, you post it to the back of each client's queue.  The clients then read the data from the front of their respective queues.  Since all the clients will probably read at different rates/times, this will ensure all of them get a copy of the data only once, and you won't get hung up waiting for any one client while more data comes in.  Of course, you'll need to allocate a certain amount of memory for each connected client's queue (I'm not sure how many clients you're expecting, and you did say your available memory is limited), and you need to consider what to do if a queue gets full before the client reads all of it. \n"

8691834	b" I asked a  question  about finding subsequences in a variable amount of sets with no repeating characters. The solution was to create a matrix of each pair of letters, discard those that don't occur in each set, and then find the  longest path  in the directed acyclic graph. However, I don't want just the longest path, I want several of the longest paths (e.g. if it generates subsequences of lengths 10, 10, 9, 8, 8, 3, 3, 2, and 1, I may want to display the first 5 subsequences only). \n\n And so, since I'm not looking for only the longest path, in order to generate the resulting subsequences, rather than using the longest path algorithm described in the wikipedia article, I'm using a naive algorithm which simply generates a list of all possible subsequences. This generates a set similar to the results in  an answer  to my previous question. \n\n The problem is that I want to reduce the amount of subsequences it is generating. \n\n For example, if I have the following sets: \n\n \n\n ... my algorithm will currently come up with the following pairs that occur in each set: \n\n \n\n This is technically correct, but I would like to eliminate some of these pairs. For example, notice that  2  always comes after  1 . Therefore, I would like to eliminate the  A2  and  B2  pairs (i.e.  A  and  B  should never jump directly to  2 ... they should always go through  1  first). Also,  1  should never jump to any number besides  2 , since  2  always occurs immediately after it. Furthermore, notice how  0  always occurs between  B  and  3 , so I would like to eliminate the pair  B3  (again,  B  should always go through  0  before it jumps to  3 , since all sets have the positions of these three letters as:  B &lt; 0 &lt; 3 ). \n\n Just to be clear, the current algorithm will come up with these subsequences: (I included only those which begin with  A  for brevity): \n\n \n\n ... and all those marked with  *  should be eliminated. \n\n The (correct) pairs which generate the desired subsequences would be: \n\n \n\n ... and the complete list of subsequences would be: \n\n \n\n In other words, I'm trying to go from this directed acyclic graph: \n\n   \n\n To this: \n\n   \n\n What sort of algorithm/logic should I use in order to get rid of these extraneous pairs (i.e. graph edges)? Or do you think that my logic in generating the pairs in the first place is the thing that should be changed? \n"

8691844	b' I found the answer in the  DDLog.h  file. Lumberjack has the concept of asynchronous and synchronous logging. At initial read, it didn\'t hit me as to what this was for. \n\n Basically, if you want the log statement to be output in sequence, one needs to make it synchronized (though, as Mike mentioned, this will slow down performance). So, this should only be done in a debugging situation. Ideally, I\'ll put another header together and/or some other pre-processor macro to ensure I don\'t leave the switch flipped on as synchronous. \n\n Here\'s what you do: \n\n \n Open up  DDLog.h  \n Go to the line with  #define LOG_ASYNC_ENABLED YES . You can change this to  NO  in one spot for synchronous logging across the board, or you can change individual levels, in the lines that follow. \n \n\n Note that the header discourages changing the DDLog.h file itself. So, following the instructions on the Lumberjack wiki page  link , they explain how to use a different header file to articulate these override customizations. \n\n Using that, here\'s what I\'ve successfully written and tested, as "MyAppLumberjack.h" header file that I import in my app\'s precompiled header: \n\n \n'

8691957	b" Nothing on the web that works in a browser can be genuinely cloaked.  The browser is just an agent requesting the file, same as any agent requesting the file for any use.  A server knows no difference between a browser downloading a JS file as part of a web page and a user downloading the JS file to view it.   To the server, they are just requests to download the file.  The server doesn't know what's going to be done with it. \n\n Even further, JS files and CSS files are usually kept in the disk cache (for performance reasons) where they can be retrieved independent of the server. \n\n The only thing you can do is to obscure your code with minification and obfuscation.  Minification makes sense because it also makes thing more efficient.  I wouldn't personally recommend obfuscation because it doesn't really stop a determined viewer - it only slows them down slightly.  If the browser can understand the JS file to run it, then so can a hacker. \n\n In general, people seem to think that their javascript is somehow way more important a secret than it really is.  If you do have some sort of secret algorithm that really needs to be protected, then your best bet is to keep the code for that on the server and use ajax calls to access it from your client javascript as needed. \n"

For example, lets assume that you've got a simple class like this: \n\n \n\n Here we have a class we have a class does not obey one of the required invariants of the equals/hashcode contract.  Specifically, two instances cal be equal, but have different hashcodes. \n\n When you add two different instances of this class to a HashSet, you  may  end up with  both  instances in the set ... on different hash chains.  You get similar anomalies when removing objects from the set, testing to see if the set contains an object, and so on.   \n\n (Note that you may get lucky, and have the two instances end up on the same hash chain despite having different hashcodes.  But your luck could change when some other unrelated object is added to the hash table, causing it to automatically resize.  The resize is liable to cause entries with different hashcodes to be redistributed to different hash chains.) \n\n \n\n \n   So I'm wondering... when is the hashcode most important ?  \n \n\n It is always important. \n\n Or to put it another way, it is only unimportant when you know with 100% certainty that instances of the class are  never ever  going to be used in hash tables.  (And I don't know how you can know that, unless you delete all copies of the class.  And that renders the whole question moot!) \n\n \n\n  UPDATE  \n\n @supercat mentioned the case where you can't write a decent hashcode. \n\n If there is some good reason you can't write a half-decent  hashcode()  method, I'd advocate overriding it to throw  UnsupportedOperationException  or some such.  That way you get a fast-fail if someone tries to put an instance into a hash table ... rather than a mysterious performance black-hole.  (I would NOT recommend returning a constant hashcode.) \n\n There is a related scenario where you might do this: when the object is  inherently  mutable, and you want to avoid the badness that happens if you mutate a hash key so that its hashcode changes. \n"

8692129	b' It might be that your idea of specificity is a little off. Specificity has to be a context-free idea: since CSS can be loaded independently of HTML, you must not need an HTML document to guess which rule is more "specific". Consider this other valid example: \n\n  &lt;div id="inner"&gt;\n  &lt;div id="container"&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;   \n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n  \n\n With this snippet, you would have to go against your initial guess that  inner  should be more specific. This means that your interpretation required context (which CSS does not have). \n\n The point is, both rules are seen with equal specificity ( h1  descendants of an element identified by an  id ), and the selector doesn\'t give higher priority to closer descendants. \n\n In case two rules of equal specificity apply, the winner is the last one declared in the CSS. \n'

8692160	b" There are basically two approaches to doing symbol resolution. \n\n Built-in symbol resolution. \n\n Depending on your system, you may be able to look up regular functions by name in a hidden symbol table used at run-time.  For example, the   dlopen()   and   dlsym()   on UNIX-like systems allow you to load a shared object library and resolve functions in that library by name.  Windows has similarly behaving functions   LoadLibrary()   and   GetProcAddress()   for dynamically linked libraries (DLLs).  You have to pay attention to the concept of  visibility .  Functions must be  exported  by the library in order to be resolved using this mechanism.  I believe GCC creates exports all functions by default (visibility is public) and Windows compilers export nothing by default.  Also note that on Windows, you can resolve functions in the host program without loading an external library because the null library handle designates the host process's executable image. \n\n In general, this is full of subtleties and not portable.  I don't recomment you build a system based on this mechanism. \n\n Manual symbol resolution: routes \n\n The modern way of mapping URLs (or parts of URLs) to  functions is to build URL  routes .  This approached is adopted by most modern web frameworks based on the MVC paradigm (Ruby on Rails, Django and ASP.NET MVC to name a few -- there are many others). \n\n This basically consists in building a map of names (or regular expressions) to callbacks (in C++, this would be a pointer to function or a  std::function&lt;&gt;  object).  If your compiler supports the up and coming standard, you should be able to populate a  std::map&lt; std::regex,std::function&lt;void()&gt;&gt;  object to implement the look-up. \n\n Here is a simple (untested) example: \n\n \n"

8692187	b' The  -static  option links a program statically, in other words it does not require a dependency on dynamic libraries at runtime in order to run.   \n\n To achieve static linking requires that the archive (.a) versions of your libraries exist on the system. so /usr/lib/libc.a /usr/lib/crt1.o etc...  \n\n On modern linux systems (as you are using red hat): when a binary links together it 1) either puts the code into the executable via .o and .a files, or 2) puts in references to dynamic libraries (.so) files that is resolved by /lib/ld-linux.so  (or /lib64/ld-linux=x86-64.so) which is always at a well known place. \n\n For your particular system, if a program is specifically looking to create a static version of itself then you need to install the static versions of your devel tools.

8692204	b' I am creating an encryption scheme with AES in cbc mode with a 256-bit key. Before I learned about CBC mode and initial values, I was planning on creating a 32-bit salt for each act of encryption and storing the salt. The password/entered key would then be padded with this salt up to 32 bits. \n\n ie. if the pass/key entered was "tree," instead of padding it with 28 0s, it would be padded with the first 28 chars of this salt. \n\n However, this was before I learned of the iv, also called a salt in some places. The question for me has now arisen as to whether or not this earlier method of salting has become redundant  in principle with the IV. This would be to assume that the salt and the iv would be stored with the cipher text and so a theoretical brute force attack would not be deterred any. \n\n Storing this key and using it rather than 0s is a step that involves some effort, so it is worth asking I think whether or not it is a practically useless measure. It is not as though there could be made, with current knowledge, any brute-force decryption tables for AES, and even a 16 bit salt pains the creation of md5 tables. \n\n Thanks,\nElijah \n'

Mainly HTML with some php includes and things here and there,\n  or mainly or even completely PHP? \n \n\n This question is independent of PHP. In brief, logic should be separated from presentation and shared functionality should be reused. The  MVC  pattern is very popular for achieving this. \n\n Speaking of mainstream sites, it\'s my opinion (based on a few facts) that MySpace lost a great deal of market share due to  not  having a properly abstracted architecture that supported rapid deployment of new features and high performance. \n\n \n   I have no idea where to go from here.

Then, once you have the username, look for a corresponding entry in the database with that username and the secret token. If one is found, then the user is logged in; if not, then the cookies are invalid. \n\n This stops people from just randomly creating a cookie because they don't know the correct value of the token for other accounts. \n"

It is O(n^2) in time and space. \nBetter ideas?  \n"
8692277	b" \n  Yes, the monitor lock is the same as the object's lock. If you do  synchronized (object) , that's the lock.  \n  In your example, the current object will give up the lock while waiting, the  wait()  call gives up the lock. In another thread,  notify()  is called to wake the object up, and when the   wait()  call returns it will hold the lock again.  \n \n"
8692281	b' getDay() returns the day of the week, Sunday = 0, Monday = 1, etc, etc. \n\n So say today was Monday getDay() would return 1, which means daysToAdd would be 5. \n\n Once we know how many days we want to add we can create a new date and add those days. We do this by getting today in milliseconds and then adding the number of days (daysToAdd) in milliseconds. \n\n We convert days to milliseconds by multiplying by 24*60*60*1000 which is the number of milliseconds in a day. \n\n I add 1 to the month because JavaScript returns 0 based month, but for display purposes we want to format it so that January for example is 1 not zero. \n\n \n\n You could implement in your code like so, JavaScript: \n\n \n\n Your HTML would be something like this: \n\n \n\n You can find the jsFiddle here:  jsFiddle  \n\n If you want to adjust the weekday so that you consider Monday the start of the week instead of Sunday you can do the following after you get the weekDay: \n\n \n'

8692315	b' \n   I know each object in Java has a lock, but what is the "monitor lock" means? is it the same as the object\'s lock? \n \n\n Yes, they are the same thing.  They are also occasionally called the object\'s "mutex" and the object\'s "primitive lock".  (But when someone talks about  Lock , they are talking about  this Java interface  ... which is a  different  locking mechanism.) \n\n \n   Why notify method needs to give up the monitor lock? \n \n\n The  notify  method  doesn\'t  give up the lock.  It is your code\'s responsibility to give up the lock (i.e. leave the synchronized block or return from the synchronized method) after the  notify  call returns. \n\n Why is that necessary?  Because any other thread that is currently waiting on that lock (in a  wait(...)  call) has to reacquire that lock before the  wait  call can complete. \n\n Why did they design  notify  /  wait  like this?  So that they can be used to implement condition variables. \n\n \n   Like the first description above, is that means the the current object is blocked by synchronized keyword, and then wait method releases the lock? \n \n\n That is correct.  When a thread calls  someObject.wait()  its lock on  someObject  is released ... and then reacquired (by the same thread) before the  wait()  call returns.  Of course, in the meantime the lock  someObject   may  have been acquired and released multiple times by  other  threads.  The point is that when  wait  returns, the thread that called  wait  will have the lock. \n'

8692326	b" I do not think authentication is separate for android applications the connect to web services.  \n\n You'd replicate the same authentication mechanism that you use in your web service on the android. That is to say, if you use http authentication in your web service (which transmits clear text passwords),  you'd replicate http authentication on the android. If you do not want to pass clear text credentials through the wire, you'd first have to implement something more secure (https) in your web service first.  \n\n For my project, I pass the clear text credentials using a POST request to the server. Browsers also transmit clear text passwords. After authentication, the service sends back a token (a database user id in a trivial case) which must be included in all future requests that requires a user to be logged in.  \n\n When storing the login id &amp; password into preferences, I use sha1 to hash it first. That does mean that next time around, my web service is passed the hashed credentials and must know how to deal with it.  \n\n This mechanism is simple and suffices for my need.

Such as: \n\n \n\n ...br being the binary reader and fs the filestream. There are many blocks like this, and it seems like bad practice to write the same thing so many times. The first thing that comes to mind is to wrap the entire thing in a try-catch statement and throw exceptions instead of using the if else blocks. I remember when reading about try-catch statements that it's good to have them, but not to wrap everything with them. To be honest, I still don't completely understand why it would be bad practice to wrap everything in try catch statements, as they only have an effect when there's an error, in which case the program is going south anyway...  \n\n Also, do I have to close the binary reader and file stream, or will closing one close the other?

8692392	b" How about making use of the  using  keyword? this wraps your use of an  IDisposable  in a try - finally block; \n\n \n\n The nested using blocks will ensure that both the filestream and binary reader are always properly closed and disposed.  \n\n You can read  more about using in MSDN . It makes the use of  IDisposable  a little neater, removing the need for explicit excpetion handling. \n\n Regarding your statement: \n\n \n   I remember when reading about try-catch statements that it's good to\n  have them, but not to wrap everything with them. \n \n\n I always use the simple rule that if I cannot handle and recover from an exception within a particular block of code, don't try to catch it. Allow the exception to 'bubble up' the stack to a point where it makes more sense to catch it. With this approach you will find that you do not need to add many try-catch blocks, you will tend to use them at the point of integration with services (such as filesystem, network etc ...) but your business logic is almost always free of exception handling mechanisms.  \n"

8692400	b" I think you can pinch ideas from e.g. Java \nSerialisation, which recognises when pointers point to nodes already serialised, so that it can serialise (and then deserialise) arbitrary structures reasonably efficiently. The spec, which you can download via a link at    , says that this is done but doesn't say exactly how - I suspect hash tables. \n\n I think copying is a lot like this - you don't even need to know that some of the pointers make up a linked list. You could use a depth first search to traverse the graph formed by the nodes and their pointers, putting the location of each node in a hash table as you go, with the value the copied node. If the node is already present you don't need to do anything except make the pointer in the copied node point to the copy of the node pointed to as given by the hash table. If the node is not already present, create the copy, put the node in the hash table with the address of the copy as its value, and recursively copy the information in the node, and its pointers, into the newly made copy. \n"

8692454	b' As fas as adding dates in JavaScipt my "DateExtensions" library does this well enough, I think.  You can get it here: \n\n     \n\n Once refenced you can call "add()" as a method for any valid date and pass it any of many date parts (second, minutes, days, hours, etc).  So assuming "curDate" is a valid JavaScript date object you can add 5 days like this: \n\n newDate = curDate.add(5, "days"); \n\n Using a negative value will subtract: \n\n newDate = curDate.add(-5, "days");  \n\n Once you get the date you want you can the use the library\'s dateFormat() method to display it like so: \n\n curDate.dateFormat("MM/DD/YYYY"); \n\n There\'s full documentation at the link. \n\n  Integer Values for Day of Week  \n\n As for getting the integer value you want, it\'s actually easier that it looks (and you don\'t need an "if" just some math).  The getDay() method of date returns the day of week with Sunday as "0" and Saturday as "6".  So the week, from Sunday, would normally be: \n\n 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 \n\n First, you want to reverse that scale.  That\'s easily done via subtraction by taking 7 (to total number of members of the set) from the value.  This gives you this scale: \n\n -7,-6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1 \n\n We\'re getting closer.  You want the first value to be zero as well.  The simplest way  (I think) to do this is to get the modulus (remainder) of the value by the total number of members.  All this basically does is make "-7" a zero and leave the rest alone giving us this: \n\n 0,-6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1 \n\n Almost done.  Finally you don\'t want negative numbers so you need to use the Math.abs() method to eliminate the sign (get the absolute value) leaving us with our desired result: \n\n 0,6,5,4,3,2,1 \n\n For all the talk the acutual code is pretty compact: \n\n Math.abs((cnt-7)%7) \n\n Wrapping this into the original example gives us: \n\n newDate = curDate.add(Math.abs((curDate.getDay()-7)%7), "days"); \n\n  Server Vs Client  \n\n However take nnnnnn\'s comment to heart: in JavaScript the getDate() function gets the current date/time of the machine that it\'s running on - in the case of a web page that\'s the client, not the server. \n\n If you actually meant the client time them you\'re set and done.  If you really need the server time however that\'s annoying-to-impossible.  If you own the server then it\'s actually not to hard to set up a rule that includes the current server in a cookie withing each fufilled request (you could then use my cookie library, also at the site above, to access the information!) \n\n It\'s messier but depending on the server you might also be able to create an old-school server-side include that adds a bit of JavaScript to each page (preferably as a marked replace in the header) that hard-codes the date as a global variable. \n\n You might also create a web service that returns the current server time but the client-overhead for that is insane compared to the data being delivered. \n\n If the server\'s NOT yours (and you can\'t get the owner to provide the above) then the only real potential option is to do a straight http call and examine the HTTP "Date" header.  Again however the overhead on this is immense compared to the return but it\'s really the only way.  Any system like this would have to be very flexible however as any particular server might not return the date header or might not return it correctly. \n\n Even if it does work understand that you might still not be getting the "server" time - or at least not the server you want.  In a tiered architecture, for example an application server might render then page and hand it to a web server to return - you\'d be getting the web server time, not the app server.  Any number of appliances might also rewrite the headers (for example it\'s common to use dedicated SSL appliances to offload all the encryption work - these often re-write the headers themselves). \n\n Sorry to get overly technical - JavaScript is definately one area where there\'s unfortunately rarely a "simple question".  ;^) \n\n Good Luck! \n'

You passed a non-class into issubclass. That indicates that you are doing something wrong. Therefore you get an error. If you seriously do want to pass instances to issubclass, you can catch that error: \n\n \n\n Or, of course, you can do what you do: An extra check. \n\n However, if it did  not  raise an error, then it would be impossible to catch the mistake of passing in an instance. \n\n From what I understand, you want to make a check in an API or similar, that the object passed in is a subclass of BaseModel, and the user should not be allowed to pass in an instance. IMO, the correct thing to do there is to raise a TypeError if they pass in the wrong thing. Like so: \n\n \n\n Making an assert there just means that you hide the fact that it is a type error to pass in the wrong thing. \n'

The user is logged. \n b) If a match is  not  found, the credentials are invalid and the user is not logged. \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n This migration can take a long time, so to speed it up you should e-mail your users asking them to log in or change their passwords. \n\n Hope it helps. \n'

This indicates which hashing method the user is using.  \n\n When the system is added with a new hashing method, the highest Hashing Level will be incremented.  \n\n Let's say if I have 2 hashing methods already \n\n \n\n If I add in a new hashing method  SHA512 , it'd become \n\n \n\n Every time the user signs in, the system will check if the user's password is the same as the one in the database, using the identified Hashing Level. There are several cases here: \n\n \n If the password hashes match, but the Hashing Level of the user is not the highest Hashing Level the system offers, then hash the input password of the user i.e. the plain text using the highest level of hashing method and set the Hashing Level of the User to the highest Hashing Level. The user is then authenticated. \n If the password hashes match and the Hashing Level of the user is the highest Hashing Level, then the user is authenticated. \n If the password hashes do not match at all, then the user is denied. \n \n\n This means that whenever you upgrade the hashing level of the system, the user's password is only upgraded to the highest level at their next authentication.  \n"

8692638	b' The pattern that you\'re using, of saving an empty record simply to get the ID, is not a good one. \n\n The standard approach, and the one that I\'d recommend, is for Create Record to simply display an empty form (the ID at this point will typically be 0). The user fills in the form and the data is only committed to the database when the user clicks Save. The ID should be an IDENTITY column. \n\n A problem with your approach is that if users do not complete the form, you end up with lots of incomplete records in your database. And, of course, it makes it much more difficult to handle data validation and integrity. \n\n An alternative approach, if you  really  must display the ID to the user, is to have a separate table containing a row with a "Next Record ID" column. This column can be incremented and returned as an atomic operation and used to populate the ID of your new record. You still don\'t create the real record, just increment this "Next Record ID" in your Create Record action. Using this approach, you can use the same approach for multiple entities by having separate rows for each in this "Record IDs" table. Bear in mind that if the user does not ultimately save the record to the database, an ID will still have been \'used up\'. The numbers will still be unique and will be chronological but won\'t necessarily be contiguous. \n'

8692834	b" I'm trying to write a seemingly simple implementation of the classic producer - consumer idiom\nin Python. There is one comparably quick producer for multiple slower consumers. In principle, this\nis easy to do using the  Queue  module, and the\nlibrary documentation has an example spawning only a few lines of code. \n\n However, I also want the code to work properly in case exceptions occur. Both the producer\nand all consumers should stop in case any of the following things happen: \n\n \n the producer fails with an exception \n any consumer fails with an exception \n the user stops the program (causing a KeyboardInterrupt) \n \n\n After that, the whole process should fail raising the initial exception to inform the\ncaller about what went wrong. \n\n The main challenge seems to be to cleanly terminate the consumer thread without ending up\nin a blocking join(). It appears to be popular to set Thread.deamon=True, but to my\nunderstanding this causes resource leaks in case the producer fails with an exception. \n\n I managed to write an implementation that fulfills my requirements (see below). However\nI find the code to be a lot more complex than expected. \n\n Is there a leaner way to deal with these scenario? \n\n Here are a couple of example calls and the resulting final log message from my current\nimplementation: \n\n Produce and consume 10 items: \n\n \n\n Produce no items: \n\n \n\n Produce 5 items for 10 consumers, thus using only some of the available consumers: \n\n \n\n Interrupt by pressing Control-C: \n\n \n\n Fail to produce item 3: \n\n \n\n Fail to consume item 3: \n\n \n\n Fail to consume the last item: \n\n \n\n And here is the probably overly complex source code: \n\n \n"

Let's try all possible outputs: \n\n \n\n So 1/4 of the time, we output 1. 1/4 of the time we output 2. 1/4 of the time we output 3. And 1/4 of the time we have to repeat the algorithm a second time. Looks good. \n\n Note that if you have to do this a lot, two optimizations are handy: \n\n 1) If you use the same range a lot, have a class that computes  p  once so you don't have to compute it each time. \n\n 2) Many CPUs have fast ways to perform step 1 that aren't exposed in high-level languages.

In my case there will be one producer which generates several  million  (non-trivial) tasks, and there will be a configurable number of consumers. \n\n Communication between producer and consumers is basically Queue-based. I\'m worried however about memory-consumption: it\'s quite conceivable that the number of tasks will exceed the available memory for the JVM.

8693013	b' You were already given answers how to fix it, but no explanation why your code was wrong. Let\'s have a look at this piece of code: \n\n \n\n Obviously you fell for the idea, that the compiler sees an array as a long string of individual bits. Also you fell for the misconception that you could bit shift arbitrarily long. However this is not how C and C++ work. The bitshift only works on the width of the types it is applied. There are some rules which type is used by the compiler depending on the participating types. So let\'s break down the types: \n\n \n\n okay, there\'s only  int  in there, so the type operated on will be  int . Depending on plattform there is only a limited number of bits. But let\'s say for convenience that  int  has 64 bits. This means that any left shift of a 1 of more than 65 bits will shift the bit out of the available bits and you\'re getting zero bits set. But we\'re not done yet. \n\n After that you\'re assigning that  int  to a  uint16_t . Now here\'s the next misconception. A type of  uint16_t  is specified to provide  at least 16 bits  (C is not very exact in those things, because it may run on a plattform where word size is not a multiple of 8 bits). But for the sake of this explanation let\'s assume that it are exactly 16 bits. The assignment \n\n \n\n coerces, i.e. it throws away the bits, not fitting into the L value. \n\n Last but not least: The expression  pcx.image.data16  is a pointer. This pointer points to the very first element of your data array. By assigning to this pointer you\'re only changing this pointer, not the data it points to. So you have to dereference the pointer. You can dereference a pointer by prepending it with a  *  or by appending a indexing operator [\xe2\x80\xa6] .  Note that  *  and  [0]  are identical!  So if you did a \n\n \n\n this would only dereference to the first array element (which will probably have 16 bits, but maybe more). Anyway: You can not assign a larger bitvector to it, that "wraps" into the next elements (and that is a good thing!). \n\n So the solution is, to iterate over all of the elements of the array, and for each element set that additional bit: \n\n \n'

8693089	b" I'm going through Java For Everyone by Cay Horstmann. \n\n I'm a bit confused on when it says: \n\n \n   Don't Use Type Tests \n \n\n This is about using  instanceof  operator for specific type tests in order to implement behavior that varies with each class like (taken straight from the book): \n\n \n\n Apparently this is a poor way to do it as if you have a new class like  NumericQuestion  added you need to revise all parts of your program that make a type test, adding another case. \n\n It is better to add class  NumericQuestion  to the program. Nothing needs to change as we are using polymorphism, not type tests.\nWhen ever you find yourself trying to use tyepe tests in a hierarchy of classes, reconsider and use polymorphism instead. Declare a method  doTheTask  in the superclass, override it in the subclasses and call  q.doTheTask()  \n\n What I don't understand is the last paragraph, the one above. Can someone shoe me an example of what it means please? (I'm kind of a visual learner). How do we actually do this without using tyep tests? \n"

8693128	b' There\'s a few things you are doing wrong here: \n\n \n  Your enumeration does not have the  [Flags]  attribute. HasFlags is designed to work only with enumerations with this attribute set.  \n  You don\'t follow the flag conventions. Unless  Type3  is a combination of  Type1  and  Type2 , it should have value  4  instead of  3 . Read up on the documentation in the  FlagsAttribute MSDN page .  \n  Your expectations are wrong:  HasFlag(Flag1 | Flag2)  returns only true of  both  Flag1 and Flag2 are set, since you are bitwise  OR -ing Flag1 and Flag2 and checking if these bits are set. Please have a look at the  HasFlag documentation  for details.  \n \n\n I suspect that your enum is meant to be  just an enum  and not a container for flags. Flags are supposed to be combinable, i.e., type could be "Type1 and Type2" or "no type" or "all types" (like font formatting, which can be "none", "bold", "italic" as well as "bold and italic", "bold and underlined", etc.). I don\'t think that applies to your case. \n\n So, forget about the flags thing and just use regular enum matching (such as  type == EmploymentType.Type1 || type == EmploymentType.Type2  or a  switch  statement) instead of the  HasFlags  method. \n'

8693193	b' Java is a strongly typed language. The types are needed to be able to compile code and validate types compatibility at compile time.  \n\n Weakly typed languages do not have types. For example when you say  var x  in JavaScript you just define variable. Then value of any type may be assigned there. This means that if for example your code has bug and you assign string to this variable and then try to divide this variable by 2 ( y = x / 2 ) the script will just fail at runtime. Java will not allow you to compile such code.  \n\n There is the principle: the bug costs x during development, x*10 during QA and x*100 if it arrives to production. Compiler and strongly typed languages allow to decrease number of (stupid) bugs that arrive to QA and therefore make software development easier, faster and cheaper.  \n'

8693221	b" With image compression, there's a fine line between creating a small file and creating a poor quality image. JPEG is a lossy compression format which means that data is removed when compressed, which is why constantly re-encoding a JPEG file will continually decrease its quality. \n\n On the other hand, PNG files are lossless but may still result in bigger files. You could try encoding the file as a PNG using  PngBitmapEncoder . This will ensure the quality remains high, but the size may or may not decrease enough for your program (it depends on the image). \n\n If you're performing this on a local machine and don't need to do it too often (e.g. for many concurrent users), you could invoke an external program to do it for you.  PNG Monster  is very good at compressing PNG files without decreasing the quality. You could call this from your program and send the resulting PNG file. (You may want to check the licensing terms to ensure that it's compatible with your program). \n\n There aren't many ways where you can maintain a high quality and perform a high compression at the same time, without manipulating the image (e.g. changing dimension). \n"

8693383	b' It is generally not possible to transform the table-related HTML attributes so that the exact appearance is preserved. The main reason is that the HTML attributes have vague definitions and different interpretations in different browsers, as you can see e.g. by viewing a page with the given attributes on IE and Firefox. It is not possible to replicate this browser-dependence in CSS. \n\n The following stylesheet, which assumes that your markup has  &lt;table class=t&gt; , tries to replicate a \xe2\x80\x9ctypical\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9caverage\xe2\x80\x9d rendering of a table with the given attributes: \n\n \n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s seldom useful to convert presentational HTML attributes to CSS.

They\'re defining the symbol to be exported for so that any other compilation unit can reference it! \n\n e.g. if, in  app.cpp , you declared  \n\n \n\n this would mean declare " A  is a variable of type  var  that some other compilation unit is going to define and export" -- with this modification to your setup, this would make  app.cpp  explicitly request to use the object named  A  that  lib.cpp  exported. \n\n The problem with your setup is that you have two different compilation units both trying to export the same symbol  A , which leads to a conflict. \n\n \n\n Because GNU can\'t know that you wanted  A  to be a variable private to your compilation unit unless you  tell  GNU that it should be private to your compilation unit. That\'s what  static  means in this context. \n'

8693521	b' This question confuses me. \n\n So this is your initial code: \n\n \n\n In your function it doesn\'t matter what I pass to it, because the second line  $var = rand();  is ALWAYS going to overwrite whatever value you pass to the function. \n\n So if I did  f("jordanmoore");  after the first line this would no longer be "jordanmoore," rather it would be a random value. \n\n Next is this line:  echo f($var ="a_").\'&lt;br/&gt;\'; /* outpu a random number */  \n\n I\'m not sure why you are trying to set  $var  here. If you want to pass "a_" to the function then just call  f("a_"); . But I\'m not sure why you\'re passing anything to the function when the value is always overwritten. If you want the format to be "a_somerandomnumber" then perhaps  echo "a_".f(null);  would be better to use? \n\n I\'m going to hesitate a guess here and rewrite your function to the following \n\n \n\n Then you may use it like so: \n\n \n\n Hope this helps. \n\n  edit  \n\n You can also then do: \n\n \n'

8693538	b' HTML syntax does not allow anything between the rows of a table, except rows of the same table. You can however insert a single-cell row of that table and put a table inside that cell; in that case you should use a  colspan  attribute that makes that cell occupy the full width of the (outer) table, in this case  &lt;td colspan=4&gt; . \n\n Alternatively, you can insert a row or rows that contain the desired data so that they are syntactically normal rows of the table, even if their content is different. Note that using CSS you can set borders, backgrounds, etc., for the cells of a row different from the rest of the table. However, the special rows must still fit into the structure of the table. For example, if a row is to contain just two cells and the table has four columns, then you need to specify, with  colspan  attributes, how the two cells are placed into the grid of the table (e.g.,  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=3&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;  would place the first cell in the first column and make the second cell span the rest of the columns, in your case). \n'

8693546	b" Passing variables by reference is a special case of function calling. Typically only the value of an  expression  is passed into the function as parameter. \n\n \n\n Here  3 * 4  is an expression that evaluates to  12 , so  12  is passed into the function. A function that expects  variables  to be passed by reference though is different, because it needs a variable: \n\n \n\n The purpose of passing by reference is to be able to modify the passed  variable , not just a value. As such, you need to actually pass it a  variable , not just a value. Calling the function with something like  f(3 * 7)  doesn't make much sense in this case. Well,  f($var = 'foo')  is the same thing.  $var = 'foo'  is an  expression , it's not simply a variable. Therefore only the result of the expression (the value) is passed, not any variable that happens to appear in the expression. \n\n To illustrate that better, which variable should be passed when doing  f($foo + $bar) ? The answer is that it just doesn't work that way. To pass a variable by reference, you can only use a variable as the parameter, not an expression. \n\n \n"

8693759	b"  Background information:  \n\n I'm working on a small app for myself and a few friends, and it contains a few  ListViews  with items based on custom XML layouts. The layouts are somewhat heavy - a few  ImageViews ,  TextViews , a  LinearLayout  and a  RelativeLayout  - so I started thinking about performance. I'm not personally experiencing any performance issues, but I know that some of my friends, who'll be using the app, don't have high-end phones and that they might have issues with these layouts. \n\n I remember watching a video presentation regarding performance in Android, and I recall Romain Guy mentioning something about custom  Views  being better for performance than constantly inflating custom XML layouts. I believe the context was the early development of the Gmail application (around Android 1.5, I believe), where each item of the  Listview  was rather complex. \n\n It's probably worth pointing out that I'm reusing  Views  in my application, and that I'm using the  ViewHolder  principle as recommended by Google. \n\n  My question:  Is it better for performance to use custom  Views  or is it OK to inflate custom XML layouts? \n"

You will see that class in the list of files for your project, but it is created automatically. Just look for the file "MyAppDelegate.m". \n\n This class is assigned delegate responsibilities in the MainWinodw.xib of "windowing" apps.

8693809	b' Somewhat simplified answer: "libraries" are an implementation detail.  All object files are combined (linked) to a  single  unit (executable)  prior  to execution.  After linking has been done, there is no trace of libraries, original source files, etc. any longer -- all that matters is the final executable. \n\n Now, you seem to be surprised that the same global name in the program (= the final result of linikng everything together) always refers to the same object.  Wouldn\'t it be confusing if it were otherwise? \n\n If file1.cpp and file2.cpp both defined a variable  A  with external linkage, how are the compiler and linker supposed to know whether you want one or two different objects?

8693824	b' It is my understanding that virtual classes resolves compile time ambiguity.  For example assume that both B and C have a getSize method.   \n\n Without virtual, a call to D.getSize attempts to use the base class getSize method.

8693828	b' Judging from the error messages, this sounds like a problem your webcam driver. The error messages are from Video4Linux (V4L or V4L2 in the error messages), which is the part of the Linux kernel that contains webcam drivers. Getting a  select()  failure and the "not supported by device" error message probably means that your webcam didn\'t implement this part of the V4L2 API. \n\n You can verify that this is the problem by testing your code with a camera that has a known-good driver. Unfortunately, this is very common in the webcam drivers included in the kernel. Many of them are reverse engineered, so it\'s quite a feat just access the video stream. \n'

You can more easily adjust the column order in the view (the  JTable ) as documented in the class javadoc of   JTable   \n\n \n   By default, columns may be rearranged in the JTable so that the view's columns appear in a different order to the columns in the model. This does not affect the implementation of the model at all: when the columns are reordered, the JTable maintains the new order of the columns internally and converts its column indices before querying the model.  \n \n\n This is achieved by using the   JTable#moveColumn   method. \n\n Adding a column to your  DefaultTableModel  is done calling the   DefaultTableModel#addColumn   method \n"

8693875	b' While you could do that directly from your PHP page, I suggest  not to do that , for many reasons, from high failure risks (in case page execution gets interrupted suddenly, for example) to security risks (your httpd user will have write access to its own configuration + some stuff on the filesystem where it shouldn\'t). \n\n Some times ago I wrote a similar control "website creation control panel" that works pretty much this way: \n\n \n The php script receives the website creation request and stores it somewhere (e.g. in a database). dot. \n Another script, running as root via cron each, let\'s say, five minutes checks the website creation requests queue. If there is any:\n \n Mark the site creation task as "locked" \n Create the directory at appropriate location, populate with scripts etc. \n Change all the permissions as needed \n Create new virtualhost configuration, and enable it \n Make the webserver reload its own configuration \n Mark the site creation task as "done" \n  \n \n\n The second script can be written in whatever language you like, PHP, Python, Bash, ... \n\n About apache configuration \n\n To create a directory "mapped" to your domain, you could use something like this: \n\n First of all, "slugify" your domain name. I usually take the (sanitized!) domain name, and convert all dots with double-dash (that is not a valid domain name part). I don\'t like dots in file/directory names a part from file extension separation. \n\n Then, you can create something like this (assuming domain is  www.example.com ): \n\n \n\n Assuming you are placing your site files in directories like  /my-sites/wwwroot/www--example--com . \n\n Some security-related improvements \n\n In my case, I also preferred  not  running the second script by root either; to do so you have to add some changes in order to let a less privileged user do some things on your system: \n\n \n Create a directory with write access for your user, let\'s say  /my-sites/conf/vhosts  \n Create an apache virtualhost containing the following line:  Include "/my-sites/conf/vhosts/*.vhost" , and enable it \n \n\n Then, let your user reload apache configuration, by installing  sudo  and adding this to your  /etc/sudoers : \n\n \n\n And, of course, also give write permissions to your websites base directory to the user that will be used to run the script. \n'
8693878	b' I think you need to add VirtualHosts to apache config (such as httpd.conf)\nlike this: \n\n \n   &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt; \n  \n   ServerName example.com  \n  \n   DocumentRoot /home/user/public_html/copy1/ \n  \n   &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; \n \n\n Apache documents for virtual host config: \n\n     \n\n     \n'
8693880	b' You can put anything as the key, but before actual use it is always converted to string, and that string is used as a key.\nSo, if you look at what  domObject.toString()  produces, you see it is not a good candidate.

8693943	b' It doesn\'t. There are two factors at play: \n\n \n   the  lifetime of the cookie  on the client-side; \nThis cookie contains the session ID.

Its lifetime is controlled via  session garbage collection settings discussed here . \n\n A commenter posted on the  session.cache_expire  documentation page, presumably actually talking about the session data: \n\n \n   What most people also don\'t know, is that most Linux distributions\n  (Debian and Ubuntu for me atleast) have a cronbjob that cleans up your\n  session dir using the value set in the global  /etc/php5/php.ini  (which\n  defaults to 24mins). So even if you set a value larger in your\n  scripts, the cronbjob will still cleanup sessions using the global\n  value. \n  \n   If you run into that situation, you can set the global value higher in\n   /etc/php5/php.ini , disable the cronjob or even better, do your own\n  session cleanup in a non-systemwide directory or a database. \n \n\n As you can see, confusing abounds amongst the community when making the distinction between session  tracking  and session data  storage .  \n \n'

8693986	b" Everything can use a different number of clocks for different CPUs.  Timing is very cpu specific.  You also need to account for wait states, flash and ram, etc.  \n\n A speedy arm microcontroller eval board with a floating point unit i and d caches can be had for $20 \n\n     \n\n or search for stm32f4 discovery (not to be confused with the stm32 value line discovery nor any of the stm8 boards). \n\n I have examples on how to use the chip/board at \n    examples \n\n Many avr based arduinos are available (http://sparkfun.com) from $30 to $50+ when you add in the serial interface, there is a lilypad kit and a pro mini kit that has everything plus the usb to serial.   \n\n Be aware that avrs are going to be significantly slower than arms from a performance perspective.  if you want to avoid getting into embedded programming the arduino sandbox removes a lot if not all of the embedded magic leaving you with apis to call as with an operating system.  ST has libraries as well, but there is more work needed on your end.  It is hard to compete with the avr specifically arduino family, when it comes to making your life easy (at the cost of some performance and other resources). \n\n The mbed     is perhaps the better of the approaches to competing with the arduino sandbox, but getting arm performance.  The maple     attempts if not succeeds (I wouldnt know) to be a drop in replacement for the avr based arduino with arm performance. \n\n Why mention all of these boards?  Because you should buy a couple and try your algorithm and find out what you really can and cant do from a performance perspective.  Many processors these days do not publish a table of clocks per instruction because the newer processors tend to execute in one clock for every instruction.  You still have to know how to count cycles.  I HIGHLY recommend Michael Abrash's book Zen of Assembly Language \n\n      \n\n used copies are affordable.  It does focus on the 8088/86, whose performance problems were fixed/moved in the next processors and their performance problems were fixed/moved and now we are mostly in a situation where the processor is not the problem it is the I/O.  For microcontrollers it is similar to the old days for size and cost the processor is still a bottleneck esp if you program in C or something other than assembler.  The Zen book will get you into the mindset of understanding the question you are asking.  The instruction set reference may only speak of one clock per instruction execution, but remember there is a clock or more needed to fetch that instruction, if that instruction performs a memory cycle there is a clock or more for that memory cycle, etc.  How many of those cycles and how can they be optimized is not only cpu/processor specific but with microcontrollers chip specific, one chip from the same company may perform quite differently than another from the same company with the same core processor.  Back to referencing Michael Abrash, basically no matter how much you think you know or have figure out about how the hardware works, you still need to run and time your code (ACCURATELY!, you can make many mistakes trying to time the code and forming conclusions based on bad testing/timing). \n"
8693987	b" Rails 2.x does make it very hard to share the model layer between two applications. \n\n If you don't care about maintaining migrations twice, you can put the models into a gem and then require it in your apps. \n\n Another way is to symlink the  db  and  app/models  directories from both applications to a shared folder. This works quite well though you have to be careful because rake tasks and generators now affect both applications. \n\n Rails 3.1 ships with an improved implementation of rails engines.

8694035	b' You should read those docs, but what you\'re looking for is: \n\n \n\n Short explanation:  mysqlconnect  is a instance method on your  Table  class. \n\n Long explanation:  Table  is an abstract concept right now -- you\'ve told the Python interpreter about it and what it should do, but you haven\'t actually made one yet.  It\'s like the blueprint, if you will, for your class.  Before you use it, or use any method defined as part of it* you\'ll need to actually "build it" first.  \n\n This is what you do when you do:  db = Table()  This tells the Python interpreter that I\'ve got this variable called  db  now and I want it to be an instance of  Table() .  Now that you\'ve got your instance, you can call the instance method (since the instance method only works on an instance) and get your result. \n\n *There are things called class methods that you can use without instantiating the class first, but you\'ll see that when you read the documentation. \n'

Your options are either to do the conversion using an external converter (like you suggest) or write code that uses a video library to load the image and create the appropriate  cv::Mat  or  IplImage *  header for the data. \n\n Unless you're processing huge quantities of video I suggest taking the path of least resistance and just converting the videos to AVI (see the above link for the details of what OpenCV supports). Just be careful to avoid lossy compression: it will wreck havoc with a lot of image processing algoritms. \n"

The server the app needs to run on is running Windows Server 2000, SQL server 2000, IIS6, and .NET 2.0.   \n\n If I run the web app on my machine with Visual Web Developer 2010 with the testing webserver in Visual studio, but accessing the database on the actual web server, it works fine.  However, If I put this app on the actual webserver, and try to access it through the browser, I get a permissions errors saying I don't have access to those tables. \n\n There are two tables my app needs to access.  On one of them I changed the permissions with SQL Management Studio to allow the public group select permissions, and that solved the problem.  On the other table (very large table) I tried to do the same, but got an error saying it timed out waiting to get a lock on the table.  Is there a way to change this timeout or another way to change the permissions? \n\n I don't believe I should even have to change the permissions though, because there are classic ASP apps on that server that access the very same tables.  I think the issue is the user that is being used to access the tables.  If I can access the tables running the web app from my machine, and classic ASP apps on the server can access them, but my ASP.NET app can't, my ASP.NET app must be using a different user account.

8694159	b' \n   Does this type of inheritance will be resolved at compile-time or run-time? \n \n\n Inheritance defines the  shape  (memory footprint) of the types and it is resolved  always  at compile time. On the other hand, access to the members of the base type will be resolved at runtime, the reason being that intermediate types in the hierarchy cannot  know  where the base subobject will be laid in memory in the most derived type. \n\n \n   I mean, how different is the meaning of virtual when used on functions and classes? \n \n\n Types and functions are different at all levels, so there is not much to say here. The only common thing is that there is a part of the work that cannot be fully resolved at compile time. In particular, the similarity is that code that uses a virtual function depends on a vptr (virtual table pointer) to find the proper vtable (virtual table) for the most derived type, and in a similar way, access to the base object requires the use of a pointer stored in each subobject of a type that derives virtually from the base. \n\n You can read more (about a particular implementation, all this is not part of the standard) in the  Itanium C++ ABI , and in particular in the  Non-POD Class Types .  \n\n As a brief summary, whenever a type D inherits virtually from a type B, the D subobject will contain a hidden pointer to the B subobject. The need for that pointer arises from the fact that the relative position of the B subobject with respect to D can change with further inheritance. \n'

8694506	b' AS, you\'d better put those question in rsdn.ru forum, I feel they are more liberal to novices than DelphiMasters. \n\n Gu, basically, you should just read manuals in Delphi XE2. It\'s all there, just read with thinking and attention. \n\n 1) you should NOT make DLL at all. You should make BPL.\nDLL is intended to co-operate with plain C interface like Win32 API.\nThose are most primitive types without any side-effects.\nC is called "machine-independent" assembler for its primitivity, and DLL interface is a kind of it. \n\n DLL may be used for compatibility with another languages, because they use another side-effects incompatible with Delphi. Then DLL enforces most primitive co-operation, with all side-effects removed from interface. By lowering intercommunication level to most simplistic types, DLL interface enforces the compatibility. \n\n But when you need to interact Delphi to Delphi then you\'d better allow Delphi to care about all compatibility issues. that is what BPL made for in Delphi 3.\nThere is just no reasons to use DLLs for this. \n\n Of course, you may shoot yourself in the foot, if u like to.\n https://forums.embarcadero.com/thread.jspa?threadID=64114  \n\n 2) You should not use WideString in XE2 but a UnicodeString instead.\nManual on strings is especially highlighting this. So it seems you just did not read manual. \n\n 3) string constants are in Unicode. (but char constants are in... in ANSI or in Unicode randomly, which leads to unexpected behaviour bugs).\nAnd there\'s no need to ask and trust anyone\'s words - just open your exe in any viewer and search for those constants, you would find them in 2-bytes UCS-2 (aka WideChar) encoding. \n\n 4) Unicode BOM is used to determine CPU byte order, is it Intel or Motorola fashion.\nWhen you develop for Windows you can only have Intel byte order, so no need to BOM. \n\n 5) the whole paragraph you wrote about lengths and memory sizes is very ambiguous. What do you mean by length, in which units it is measured, where do you take it from? \n\n I assume that by length you meant count of characters not including any "behind the hood" service structures/characters. That is what built-in function System.Length(string or array) returns.\nHowever if this assumption is wrong, then the answer below becomes wrong too. \n\n And the question if you should multiply by 2 is just a sign of bad code.\nYou should always multiply by something, years ago you already should multiply.\nMultiply by... what? By SizeOf(char-variable used) or SizeOf(char-type used).\nThen t would be Delphi that would automatically determine how much memory needed.\nAnd dealing with C-string you should use not length, but length+1 - don\'t forget about #0 terminator. \n\n 6)  How should we work with ANSI strings in different Windows Code Pages? If we receive an ANSI string with code page 1200, should we re-code the string or work with it as-is?  \n\n RTFM !!!\nJust declare type AnsiString with code page 1200.\nor use RawByteStrnig and SetCodePage.\nRead the real code below. \n\n Again, RTFM - that ALL is described in built-in help.\nIt only takes 2 hours to read it ALL in built-in help of Delphi XE2. \n\n 7)  how should we use the TEncoding class to convert between Unicode, UTF-8, WideString, and AnsiString classes?  TEncoding is made for TStringList or something like that.\nWhy should you? There is UTF8String type - just use it. \n\n var as: AnsiString; ucs2s: string; utf8string: UTF8String;\n... as := ucs2; utf8s := as; .... \n\n 8)  Are there any severe performance penalties using wide strings or Unicode strings? \nThat is depending upon which "Unicode" you mean, UCS-2 or UTF8. And which operations do you want to use.\nJust make a looong loop and measure the time. \n\n 9)  Should we write our interfaces to require length parameters for PChar, PAnsiChar, and PWideChar parameter types? \nThat is you choice, do as you wish.\nUsually PChar is C-string ended with #0. And this is how StrLen function works.\nIf you ignore that convention and use it like untypes Pointer - then pass length separately. \n\n ALL those question are already answered in help!!! Just read it. \n\n \n\n \n'

8694597	b' You can define your own subclass of  NSManagedObject , and set all of your entities to use it. \n\n The subclass can have whatever initialiser/save patterns you define, so long as it calls the proper parent class\'s initialiser. \n\n You could have a  +entity  method, which might link to a statically defined context (this will restrict you to a single managed object context of course, but that\'s not always bad as long as you can also call the more primitive initialisers when you need a second context). \n\n You might even have a  +entityWithName:  method. \n\n As for saving the context, once again you can always define a subclass and add a simple  -save  method which saves the context and throws an exception if the save fails. You may choose to do this with a category extending the  NSManagedObject  class, instead of a subclass. \n\n Note it is impossible to save  just  the change you made to that one entry object. You can only save all changes to an  entire  managed object context. If you need to save a single record, then you need to create a temporary managed object context, make a single change in it, then save the temporary context, and then sync the temporary context change over to all other managed object context\'s that currently exist in the app (there is an API to do make this complicated process relatively easy). \n\n I don\'t like the code you posted to save the context, for several reasons: \n\n \n Don\'t define a  managedObjectContext  variable that just points to  self.managedObjectContext . In almost all situations that\'s an extra line of code for no benefit. At best you\'re making your code hard to read, at worst you might be introducing bugs. \n Why are you checking if it is  nil ? Usually you should design your code so that it cannot ever be  nil . Do the  nil  check in the constructor of your object, and if it\'s  nil  that is a critical failure. Your whole app is completely useless for the user, and you should make it clear to the user that they can\'t use the app by doing something drastic, such as a crash (an error alert first would be nice, but I wouldn\'t bother. I\'d just throw an exception). \n Why are you doing a check for  hasChanges ? I cannot think of many situations where you would need to do this check. Perhaps your app is allowing a user to make many changes, and then saving them several minutes later? This is bad. The context should be changed milliseconds after a group of changes are made, or else you\'re risking data loss. Your app could crash, the phone could run out of battery, or the user might receive a phone call and your app is consuming enough RAM that the OS will terminate it instantly in order to present the "incoming call" screen. You shouldn\'t need to check for  hasChanges  because you always perform a save operation immediately after making some changes. \n As I kind of mentioned before, if the save fails you should present an error to the user then throw an exception. Avoid using  NSLog()  in deployment code, it\'s really only useful for development and beta builds. \n \n'

Some of these can have any number of declarations. A definition provides an instance. \n   In the entire program, an object or non-inline function cannot have more than one definition; if an object or function is used, it must have exactly one definition. You can declare an object or function that is never used, in which case you don\'t have to provide a definition. In no event can there be more than one definition. \n   Some things, like types, templates, and extern inline functions, can be defined in more than one translation unit. For a given entity,  each definition must be the same . Non-extern objects and functions in different translation units are different entities, even if their names and types are the same. \n   \n \n\n You may be looking for the   PIMPL idiom  , which is a way to "hide" private members from the public interface (i.e. the public header file). \n'

The problem with this is that if the app ever does die (server reboot, IIS restart, etc.), the app will be dead until someone makes a real request, at which point it will stay alive indefinitely again. \n\n This technique is sometimes used to simulate a task scheduler in ASP.NET. Just keep in mind that it's not perfect. \n\n  EDIT : For clarification, you wouldn't just create a new cache item, you'd actually make a request to a page which would then in turn create the cache item. This ensures that another request is made through IIS, which in turn runs the full lifecycle, keeping the app alive. \n\n Even if you do set your session timeout high, there's no guarantee that it will hold. I've dealt with hosting companies who will recycle your application pool after just a couple minutes of inactivity, killing any sessions you may have open. They don't care that you may have sessions open - they are just trying to squeeze every CPU cycle they can out of their servers. So if you're on shared hosting, you may want to keep that in mind - you may not be able to control how often they kill your app. \n"

8694693	b' When you use a multi-page template like this the JS will be ignored when you click from page A to page B. This is because jQuery Mobile AJAX linking pulls just the first  data-role="page  element from the new page and appends it to the current DOM, as you can imagine this ignores any code outside the  data-role="page  element. \n\n Two fixes: \n\n \n  Put the JavaScript code for  page B  directly in the  data-role="page  element so it will be parsed when jQuery Mobile does an AJAX load of the page.  \n  Put all the code for your site into a single JS include file and include it in the  &lt;head&gt;  of every page; this way all the code for your site will be available whether the user refreshes or deep-links into the site and when they navigate around using jQuery Mobile\'s AJAX linking.

8694863	b' You are right to avoid using message strings programmatically to differentiate exceptions. Your best bets to differentiate exceptions that use the same type are the following: \n\n \n The   Data   dictionary; this is not used all that often, but you can check if there are any data values that differ between the types. \n The   InnerException   type (if there is one). \n \n\n The   HResult   value is useful but is not accessible (it is a  protected  property -- you would need reflection to read it). It also tends to be the same value for the same exception type. \n\n I should point out that more often than not, if two exceptions have the same runtime type, they are generally expected to be handled the same way. Evaluate if you  really  need to handle them differently. \n'

8694883	b' There is plethora of jump/call opcodes and some of them are relative. I\'d say you in fact got not  E8 FD  but  E8 FD FF .  E8  seems to be "call 16-bit relative" and  0x100  is the place where instructions are placed by default. \n\n So you put  call 0x100  at address 0x100, and the generated code is "do the jump instruction, and jump -3 from the actual instruction pointer".  -3  is because the shift is computed from the position  after  the instruction is read, which in case of  E8 FD FF  is 0x103. That is why the shift if  FD FF , big-endian for  0xfffd , which is 16-bit  -3 . \n'

The matter of the fact is if in C# they serve mostly as an alternative to interfaces and polymorphism.

8694947	b" Yes, delegates are in many ways like single-method interfaces. However: \n\n \n There is support built into the CLR for them \n There's support in the framework for them, including multi-cast abilities and asynchronous invocation \n There's additional C#/VB language support in the form of method group conversions, lambda expressions, anonymous methods \n They're mandated for events (i.e. events and delegates are a sort of matching pair) \n They mean you  don't  need to implement an interface in a separate class for each delegate instance you want to create. \n \n\n The last point is the most important one - consider a LINQ expression of: \n\n \n\n Now imagine if to express the logic of  x &gt; 5  and  x * x  you had to write a separate class for each expression, and implement an interface: the amount of cruft vs useful code would be ridiculous. Now of course the language  could  have been designed to allow conversions from lambda expressions into interface implementations via separate classes, but then you'd still lose the benefit of being able to simply write a separate method and create a delegate with that as the target. You'd also still lose the multi-cast abilities. \n\n As a similar thought exercsise, consider looping statements such as  while  and  for . Do we really  need  them when we've got  goto ? Nope. But life is much better  with  them. The same is true of delegates - and indeed properties, events, etc. They all make the development simpler. \n"

The "reference" is a string so it will fit right into Redis. This means you won\'t have to .stringify() and .parse() to put/get a copy in the database. However, the object\'s data will be destroyed when Node shuts down unless its serialized. \n\n  var OBJECT = Object.prototype;\nOBJECT.rhash = {};\nOBJECT.rset = function(id, object) {\n  OBJECT.rhash[id] = object;\n  return id;\n};\nOBJECT.rget = function(id) {\n  return OBJECT.rhash[id];\n};\n\nvar dog = {\n  name: "Skippy",\n  food: "Bacon",\n  bark: function() {\n    alert(this.name + "!");\n  }\n};\n\nvar id = OBJECT.rset("a123", dog);\nvar ref = OBJECT.rget("a123");\nref.bark();\n  \n'

8695089	b" Why are you against reservoir sampling?  You happen to be doing it with k = 1.  There are minor optimizations (e.g. you don't need to select 1 out of the k, since k = 1) but it's the right approach.  You could try to optimize by keeping processing a fixed window at a time, do the math to figure out with equal probability if you should choose any of the items in your window instead of the one you have, etc. to minimize rand() calls at the expensive of a more complicated algorithm, but you're going to wind up back at reservoir sampling more or less anyhow. \n"

Only for greater numbers does it start to have a more intuitive speed, the iteration also being faster than the recursion. \n\n Why the same speed for 10 times as for 10,000 times? \n'
8695106	b' Solution in C (implementation of reservoir sampling with k=1):\nYou may want to use "unsigned long long" for count. \n\n \n\n Keeping k nodes per iteration is easy, when k=1. \nIt does run rand() each time, which is somewhat heavy. You may get reasonable results with a much simpler pseudo-random function. But this would make the code more complicated, not more simple.  \n'

Lowe, "  Automatic panoramic image stitching using invariant features  ," International Journal of Computer Vision, 74, 1 (2007), pp. 59-73. \n\n The process is basically this: \n\n \n Extract image features at repeatable keypoints. \n Do image-to-image matching to find out overlap areas between images. \n Do bundle adjustment to align all the matching images. \n Rendering tricks so that the output looks nice. \n \n\n The above reference uses SIFT features, described in this paper: \n\n David G. Lowe, "  Distinctive image features from scale-invariant keypoints  ," International Journal of Computer Vision, 60, 2 (2004), pp. 91-110. \n\n Prerequisites to understanding this material include: \n\n \n  image gradients  \n interest points ( corner detection ,  difference of gaussians ) \n descriptor types (simple image patches, SIFT, SURF) \n approximate  nearest neighbor search  (I\'d suggest using the  FLANN  library for this) \n  RANSAC  \n linear algebra (especially  homographies ) \n  non-linear least-squares minimization  techniques (like the  Levenberg\xe2\x80\x93Marquardt algorithm ) \n \n\n Koan suggests an excellent textbook in his answer. \n\n It\'s possible to use a lot of existing code to do feature extraction ( VlFeat  provides Matlab and C++ libraries), RANSAC, and minimization (I don\'t know what the best libraries are for those, though). OpenCV is also a very good computer vision library. \n\n How long do you have for this project? I think it\'s quite ambitions. Based on having no experience in computer vision, I think a pretty good goal would be to find the transformation between just  two images  and stitch them together. You\'d learn a lot just from that. \n'

8695173	b' I think the problem is in your implementation of recurse.  Unless I am reading it incorrectly, recurse only runs 4 times and iterates 1 to 10 in each.  While iterate calculates 10^4 - 10,000 and then counts from 0 to 10,000.   \n\n So, you are not doing a fair comparison. \n\n Revision:  If you are truly getting responses in the 0.5ms range, then you may have exceeded the accuracy of the functions involved.

You're not going to get a proper result unless the test itself takes at least a second. Run it one million times and then divide the total time. When you're testing something that's going to take only a millisecond or two, you should make sure the test takes long enough to ignore the differences of cold cache, times of .Start() and .Stop() calls, small GC delay in the meantime, etc. Also make sure the actual work takes more time than empty counting loop (that is  for(many times) recurse(x)  has high enough  x  that the  for  itself is not relevant) \n\n Your result of 0.5ms in a single run is more or less meaningless here. Also if it's a jitted language, I'd recommend calling the same function before testing, to ensure it's already compiled - otherwise it's going to add overhead. \n\n TL;DR - overhead of other things happening around your function is higher than the time your function takes to execute. \n"

8695290	b" To make a hot observable, I would probably start with a method that uses a  BehaviorSubject  as the return value and the way the operations report progress.  If you just want the example, skip to the end.  The rest of this answer explains the steps. \n\n I will assume for the sake of this answer that your long-running operations do not have their own way to be called asynchronously.  If they do, the next step may be a little different.  The next thing to do is to send the work to another thread using an  IScheduler .  You may allow the caller to select where the work happens by making an overload that takes the scheduler as a parameter if desired (in which case the overload that does not will pick a default scheduler).  There are quite a few overloads of  IScheduler.Scheduler , of which several are extensions methods, so you should look through them to see which is most appropriate for your situation; I'm using the on that takes only an  Action  here.  If you have multiple operations that can all run in parallel, you can call  scheduler.Schedule  multiple times. \n\n The hardest part of this will probably be determining what the progress is at any given point.  If you have multiple operations going on at once, you will probably need to keep track of how many have completed to know what the current progress is.  With the information you provided, I can't be more specific than that. \n\n Finally, if your operations are cancellable, you may want to take a  CancellationToken  as a parameter.  You can use this to cancel the operation while it is in the scheduler's queue before it starts.  If you write your operation code correctly, it can use the token for cancellation as well. \n\n \n"

8695980	b' It\'s good that you know CBC, as it is certainly better than using ECB mode encryption (although even better modes such as the authenticated modes GCM and EAX exist as well). I think there are several things that you should know about, so I\'ll explain them here. \n\n \n\n Keys and passwords are not the same. Normally you create a key used for symmetric encryption out of a password using a key derivation function. The most common one discussed here is PBKDF2 (password based key derivation function #2), which is used for PBE (password based encryption). This is defined in the latest, open PKCS#5 standard by RSA labs. Before entering the password need to check if the password is correctly translated into bytes (character encoding). \n\n The salt is used as another input of the key derivation function. It is used to prevent brute force attacks using "rainbow tables" where keys are pre-computed for specific passwords. Because of the salt, the attacker cannot use pre-computed values, as he cannot generate one for each salt. The salt should normally be 16 bytes (128 bits) or longer. It also ensures that identical passwords do not have the same derivation results. \n\n The output of the key derivation function is a secret of  dkLen  bytes, where  dkLen  is the length of the key to generate, in bytes. As an AES key does not contain anything other than these bytes, the AES key will be identical to the generated secret.  dkLen  should be 16, 24 or 32 bytes for the key lengths of AES: 128, 192 or 256 bits. \n\n \n\n OK, so now you finally have an AES key to use. However, if you simply encrypt each plain text block with this key, you will get identical result if the plain text blocks are identical. CBC mode gets around this by XOR\'ing the next plain text block with the last encrypted block before doing the encryption. That last encrypted block is the "vector". This does not work for the first block, because there  is  no last encrypted block. This is why you need to specify the first vector: the "initialization vector" or IV. \n\n The block size of AES is 16 bytes  independent  of the key size. So the vectors, including the initialization vector, need to be 16 bytes as well. Now, if you only use the key to encrypt e.g. a single file, then the IV could simply contain 16 bytes with the value  00 h. This does not work for multiple files, because if the files contain the same text, you will be able to detect that the first part of the encrypted file is identical. This is why you need to specify a different IV for each encryption you perform with the key. It does not matter what it contains, as long as it is unique, 16 bytes and known to the application performing the decryption. \n\n Now there is one trick that might allow you to use all zero\'s for the IV all the time: for each plain text you encrypt using AES-CBC, you could calculate a key using the same password but a different salt. In that case, you will only use the resulting key for a single piece of information. This might be a good idea if you cannot provide an IV for a library implementing password based encryption. It\'s CPU unfriendly however: the PBKDF2 function is deliberately CPU unfriendly. \n\n \n\n IV\'s and salts are completely separate terms, although often confused. In your question, you also confuse bits and bytes, key size and block size and rainbow tables with MD5 tables (nobody said crypto is easy). One thing is certain: in cryptography it pays to be as secure as possible; redundant security is generally not a problem, unless you really (really) cannot afford the extra resources. \n\n \n\n When you understand how this all works, I would seriously you to find a library that performs PBE encryption. You might just need to feed this the password, salt, plain data and - if separately configured- the IV. \n'

8696124	b" Let's see... a rather naive approach would be this: Assign each value so many bits as is necessary to hold it. That is, you'd have eight 3-bit values, one 2-bit value, and ten 4-bit values. That's 8*3+2+10*4=66 bits. Well, if you skip that last one, you'll get 62 bits.

The industry-standard  AES  (aka Rijndael) operates on 128-bit blocks, which might be a bit too lengthy - or maybe not, depending on your preferences.  3DES  won't be any worse for your purposes, and works on 64-bit blocks, which is just perfect. \n\n When you've got your encrypted 64 or 128 bits, just hex-encode them and make that the URL. If it's 64 bits, you'll have 16 hex characters. Not too much. And you'd be hard pressed to go lower anyway. Plus, it uses only 0-9, A-F, and there is little chance of mix-ups when calling over the phone. Not that people often share links vocally these days. :P \n"

8696131	b" Several times I discovered that site visitors get scared off by browser warning messages in https pages due to resources being loaded insecurely by the page. This is especially disastrous when it kills conversion rates in signup or payment pages since there's no noticeable backend error nor a client-side javascript error that can be caught... \n\n There are the relatively simple problems of an image/css/js file being linked with an absolute url that's in http protocol. However, I also encountered such https warnings that are due to a social plugin like plusone which, inside its iframe (which has a https src), may load insecure resources occasionally. \n\n Therefore, I'm wondering if there's any simple and elegant way to automate checking secure pages that can verify if they would load in an actual browser without any https warning. \n"

8696655	b" I created an AMP web application that was originally going to be served from a traditional 3rd party host. \n\n As we finished up, the client decided to host it internally, on a server in their office network.  The application is only meant to be available to staff members, but those staff members will often be off-site.  I had no involvement in setting up their network, which uses at least one server running windows server 2003.  The client machines I saw were XP. \n\n I set up Apache, MySQL and PHP on the server 2003 machine, and installed the application.  The application is built on the CodeIgniter framework, so I set the base_url to the internal IP (192.168...), and we tested from within the network.  Everything worked fine. \n\n Next, we asked their network guy to open port 80 for apache.  I set the base_url to the external IP, and tested from my home (using the external IP as the web address), and it works fine. \n\n However, when attempting to access the application using the external IP from within the network, they're unable to connect.  I can reset the base_url to the network IP, and they can access it using the network IP, but then it the application fails when connecting externally (since the base_url, used throughout the application, is pointing to the internal IP). \n\n It suppose I could let CodeIgniter determine the base_url (by leaving the variable as an empty string), but would rather figure out why the external IP fails in-network, and try to correct that. \n\n The server we're using is not dedicated to the AMP stack (in fact, it has at least one other application broadcasting to the internet that must have been using IIS, as well as an FTP server used for office scanners), so I suppose there might be some conflicts there. \n\n I know very little about windows networking.  A quick search suggested this might be because of NAT, but didn't offer a work-around.  \n\n Their network guy has no suggestions, and said that everything should be fine. \n\n Is it possible to have users inside the network access the Apache server using the external IP, and if so, what needs to happen to enable that? \n\n TYIA \n"

8696678	b" This isn't Apache related, nor is it CI related. It's often impossible to reach the external IP address from within the network. \n\n Frankly, I don't know exactly why that is. I do know that it's related to how NAT (Network Address Translation) works or at least how it's implemented. \n\n For a detailed overview of  why  this is, you should ask this question on  serverfault . If you're simply a programmer who has to deal with it, accept that NAT usually works only from inside to outside and outside to inside, but not inside to inside. \n\n You already mentioned one of the solutions in your question - don't use  base_url . You could also simply run the server on an external IP address (not your company IP, but let's say a datacenter or something). \n"
8696689	b" Your client's NAT router is configured to forward packets arriving on its external interface for its external IP with port  80  to the internal machine, port  80 , after re-writing the source and destination IP addresses in the packets. \n\n From within the network, attempts to connect to the external IP address will be routed to the  default route  on the machines, the router's  internal  interface. This interface is  not  configured to forward packets  back into the network . \n\n Configure the application to listen on all IP addresses. Make sure that the server knows that the clients know it under several hostnames -- the internal IP address and the external IP address. \n\n You might be able to re-write the NAT firewall rules on the router to perform the port forwarding for the internal interface as well, but off-the-shell equipment common in homes and small businesses do  not  make this task easy. More expensive gear (or home-built *BSD/Linux router machines) can do this without much effort, but it would needlessly add traffic to the router. \n"

(which is what that expression does). (You probably already understand it but I always like to write expressions fully commented - can\'t help myself!) So here it is broken down: \n\n  $re = \'/ # Match line with no colons or left parentheses.\n    ^           # Anchor to start of line.\n    (           # Step through line one-char at a time.\n      (?!       # Assert that this char is NOT...\n        (:|\\()  # either a colon or a left paren.\n      )         # End negative lookahead.\n      .         # Safe to match next non-newline char.\n    )*          # Step through line one-char at a time.\n    $           # Anchor to end of line.\n    /xm\';\n  \n\n If that is what you really want, fine. But if this is the case then the above expression can be greatly simplified (and sped up) as: \n\n  $re = \'/ # Match line with no colons or left parentheses.\n    ^           # Anchor to start of line.\n    [^:(\\r\\n]*  # Zero or more non-:, non-(, non-EOL.\n    $           # Anchor to end of line.\n    /xm\';\n  \n\n And just for the sake of completeness, if what you really,  really  need is to match are lines  "having at least one semicolon but no colons or left parentheses"  Then this one will do that: \n\n  $re = \'/ # Match line with ; but no : or (\n    ^            # Anchor to start of line.\n    [^;:(\\r\\n]*  # Zero or more non-:, non-;, non-(.\n    ;            # Match one ; (minimum required).\n    [^:(\\r\\n]*   # Zero or more non-:, non-(.\n    $           # Anchor to end of line.\n    /xm\';\n  \n\n When working with regex is extremely important to  precisely  define the requirements up front in the question. Regular expressions are a very precise language and they will only do what is asked of them. \n\n I hope this helps! \n'

8696929	b' Use a  java.util.concurrent.SingleThreadExecutor  and make a  Runnable  out of each HTTP operation and result-handler.  You can submit subsequent tasks to it as you determine whether you need to continue progress. \n\n For example, the HTTP "task" would run and submit the Result "task" on success, or the Error "task" on failure.  The Result task would in-turn submit another HTTP task when it was done processing.  Using  SingleThreadExecutor  ensures only one task runs at-a-time. \n\n You could use a  ThreadPoolExecutor  if you can handle multiple operations in-flight at once. \n\n Take all that, and wrap it in an  AsyncTask  that manages the top-level "kick-off" and waits for everything to complete.  It would probably be useful to have a  ConditionVariable  or something to synchronize the "end" signal (using a Done "task") so you can safely tear down the  Executor . \n\n A  SynchronousQueue  doesn\'t do anything helpful for you here, because it leaves you to do all the tread management.  If you use an  Executor  that is all handled and all you deal with is  Runnable s and  Future s.  That\'s probably why you are not finding any tutorials.  Anyway, the  Executor s all use one of those queue implementations underneath! \n\n As requested, here is some skeleton Java code.  Unsupported untested as-is.  This should get you started.  You can use a different synchronization object if you don\'t like  ConditionVariable . \n\n This is a generic technique, not specific to Android, feel free to use it in other contexts. \n\n This functions as a State Machine, with  HttpTask  et al forming the states, and the transitions are hard-coded by submitting the Next State to the  ExecutorService .  There\'s even a "Big Bang at the end, so everyone knows when to clap" in the form of the  ConditionVariable . \n\n Some may consider  DoneTask  and  FailedTask  overkill, but it keeps the Next State mechanism consistent, and lets  Future&lt;? extends ResultTask&gt;  function as a somewhat type-safe container for the results, and certainly keeps you from mis-assigning to it. \n\n \n'

8696977	b' Lua already has the necessary mechanisms to do something not entirely unlike exceptions. Namely  pcall . \n\n You can use  pcall  to execute any Lua function. If that function (or any function it calls) calls  error  ( assert  calls  error  if the assertion condition is not true), then flow control will return to the site of the  pcall  statement. The  pcall  will return false and an error message (what is passed to  error ). \n\n With this, you can "throw" errors and "catch" them. Your "try" is just the  pcall ; your "catch" statement is what checks the  pcall  result. \n\n Also, remember: Lua is a garbage collected environment. You shouldn\'t need to do any cleanup work. Or if you do, you need to change whatever Lua module requires it. Lua APIs should be Lua APIs, not C or C++ APIs. \n'

But if I change to  \\d{1,2}?  it will print all. I thought, according to all the sources I read so far, that  {1,2}  mean: one digit but no more than two. So it should have printed only  1  and  2 , correct? What do I need to extract items that contains ONLY one to two digits? Thanks for any help. \n'
8696996	b" No, because while the regex only matches two digits,  $chk  still contains  123 . If you want to only print the part that is matched, use  \n\n \n\n Note the parentheses and the $1. This causes it to print only that which is in the parentheses. \n\n Also, this code doesn't make much sense: \n\n \n\n Because @_ already is an array it makes no sense to make it into a string and then split it. Simply do: \n\n \n\n You also do not need to use  chomp  for data that is not coming from user input, as it is intended to remove the trailing newline. There is no newline in any of this data. \n"

8697182	b" TL;DR version:  MSVC's behavior is actually correct, although the warning is incorrect (it should say  value-initialized ).  \n\n \n\n For  new (p) buf_type; , MSVC is correct to perform default initialization, because the standard (5.3.4  [expr.new] ) demands: \n\n \n   A  new-expression  that creates an object of type  T  initializes that object as follows: \n  \n   \n   If the  new-initializer  is omitted, the object is  default-initialized  (8.5); if no initialization is performed, the object has indeterminate value. \n   Otherwise,  the  new-initializer  is interpreted according to the initialization rules  of  8.5 for direct-initialization. \n   \n \n\n  std::array  is a class type.  For class types (8.5  [dcl.init] ): \n\n \n   To  default-initialize  an object of type  T  means: \n  \n   \n   if  T  is a (possibly cv-qualified) class type, the default constructor for  T  is called (and the initialization is ill-formed if  T  has no accessible default constructor); \n   \n \n\n default-initialization leaves the memory unchanged only for primitive types (and raw arrays thereof) \n\n On the other hand,  std::array  has a defaulted default constructor, so the members themselves ought to be default-initialized.  And in fact you observed that. \n\n \n\n Then according to the same section, the  new (p) buf_type();  version causes direct-initialization. \n\n  \n std::array  is an aggregate, so I think this rule (8.5.1  [dcl.init.aggr] ) then applies: \n\n \n   If there are fewer  initializer-clauses  in the list than there are members in the aggregate, then each member not explicitly initialized shall be initialized from an empty initializer list (8.5.4). \n \n\n And that means value-initialization for all elements.\n  \n\n Nope, here's the rule (8.5  [dcl.init] ): \n\n \n   An object whose initializer is an empty set of parentheses, i.e.,  () , shall be value-initialized. \n \n\n Value initialization of an aggregate means value initialization of all elements, since the elements are primitive, that means zero fill. \n\n So MSVC's behavior is actually correct, although the warning is incorrect (it should say  value-initialized ). \n\n It's already been reported, see \n\n \n  VC9 erroneously generates C4345 when compiling value-initialized placement new expressions  \n \n"
8697207	b" Background: One of the problems with using a local static variable in a function as an implementation of the singleton pattern is that if more than one thread calls the function for the first time at the same time, the initialisation of the static variable could be done twice. \n\n My question is, if you wrap the initialisations of the static variables in a critical section, will that prevent the double initialisation from happening? Example: \n\n \n\n Or is the initialisation done magically (not at the point of the declaration/initialisation), like the initialisation of variables member before the beginning of a constructor? \n\n My question is specifically about pre-C++11 since, as per Xeo's answer, C++11 takes care of this by itself. \n"

8697219	b" C++11 removes the need for locking. Concurrent execution shall wait if a static local variable is already being initialized. \n\n  \xc2\xa76.7 [stmt.dcl] p4  \n\n \n   If control enters the declaration concurrently while the variable is being initialized, the concurrent execution shall wait for completion of the initialization. \n \n\n \n\n For C++03 we have this: \n\n  \xc2\xa76.7 [stmt.dcl] p4  \n\n \n   The zero-initialization (8.5) of all local objects with static storage duration (3.7.1) is performed before any other initialization takes place. A local object of POD type (3.9) with static storage duration initialized with constant-expressions is initialized before its block is first entered. An implementation is permitted to perform early initialization of other local objects with static storage duration under the same conditions that an\n  implementation is permitted to statically initialize an object with static storage duration in namespace scope (3.6.2).  Otherwise such an object is initialized the first time control passes through its declaration ; \n \n\n The last part is important, since it applies to your code. When control first enters  get_class_instance() , it first passes through the initialization of the critical section, then through the declaration of the singleton (as such will initialize it inside the critical section), and then will pass through the deinitialization of the critical section. \n\n So from a theoretical point of view, your code should be safe. \n\n Now, this can be improved though, as to not enter the critical section on every function call. The basic idea of @Chethan is sound, so we'll base it on that. However, we're going to avoid the dynamic allocation too. For that, however, we're relying on Boost.Optional: \n\n \n\n Boost.Optional avoids the default initialization, and the double check avoids entering the critical section on every function call. This version however introduces a call to the copy constructor of  Class  in the assignment. The solution to that are inplace factories: \n\n \n\n My thanks go to @R. Martinho Fernandes and @Ben Voigt who collaborated to this final solution. If you're interested in the process, feel free to take a look at the  transcript . \n\n \n\n Now, if your compiler supports some of the C++11 features already, but not the static initialization stuff, you can also use  std::unique_ptr  combined with placement new and a static aligned buffer: \n\n \n"

8697395	b' This warning refers strictly to a change that occurred in the way Visual Studio would interpret and compile that statement from a previous version. "Behavior change" means that "if you wrote this with an older VC++, watch out, things have changed." It is not meant to say that the first example is equivalent to the second. \n\n In fact, this is the compiler conforming closer to the C++ standard. It isn\'t a warning that those things WILL be equivalent - it is a warning that they ONCE WERE but now, aren\'t. You extrapolated what "default initialized" means incorrectly. \n\n Normally, a POD object that is placement-new\'d SHOULD NOT be default initialized, so this warning is correct in telling you that () will make it happen. However, it isn\'t a warning against doing this per se, but as I said, Microsoft noting a change. \n\n An std::array is guaranteed (so says MSDN documentation) to be a POD type when the type supplied is POD (such as char). A POD type is basically plain-old-data: the compiler treats it as if it were just an object. Even though it is a class, no initialization is performed on it unless explicitly called for, the same as it wouldn\'t initialize a standard C array pointer (and, in fact, cannot). \n\n Let\'s go to some C code for some illumination. \n\n \n\n And, \n\n \n\n What happens behind the scenes is a little bit different, but this is conceptually  exactly  what happens. Both statements tell the compiler to place the object at that location; the one with the () at the end tells it to call the default constructor afterwards. \n\n Yes, this can be an annoying syntactic ambiguity if you forget your ()\'s in your new\'s when you\'re writing POD objects. But almost nobody ever does, which is part of why PODs are often mis-understood. \n'

8697773	b' You can\'t do this with just cookies. \n\n Cookies are stored  per-browser  (and sometimes even  per-mode  or  per-session ) and, in any case, can be  cleared  by the user at whim. \n\n Now,  evercookie  tries to get about this, by storing the data in  many  different ways, in the hope that not all of them are cleared [simultaneously].   These methods employeed, however, are still generally confined to a given browser/profile   and depend upon which additional mechanisms can be employeed. ( EC can also be bypassed simply by disabling JavaScript, adjusting the [cookie or in-flight] values with a debugging tool, or using a non-browser to initiate requests. ) \n\n Anyway, when using the EC approach (it may have limited success, depending upon demographic, but it is  far from  being "hackproof"), simply set a [large] "random value" if no value is set, and always send that value to the server. (There really is no point requiring a nonce from the server as the server has no way to verify the original request was not "duplicate", which is sort of a catch-22.) \n\n Happy coding. \n'

8698127	b' In the second case:  \n\n \n\n You\'ve used  $(this)  inside an anonymous function, it\'s pointing at the  document  object. You fixed it by putting the "work" inside of a  .each()  where jQuery was kind enough to set the context of  this  to what you had expected, your target.  jsFiddle  \n\n Your final solution is pretty much optimised. You are asking for a different action to be taken for each element of the matched set depending on some logic relating to its properties, so you are going to have to iterate over all of them in some way.The only change I would make is: \n\n \n\n \n ALWAYS use triple = when checking for strict equality  \n The\nself-executing anonymous function was redundant  \n Personally if I\'m\ngoing to use a ternary for a switch case, I\'d do it when saving the\nvariable. \n \n'
8698128	b' I was wondering, if we have two tables that share one column in common and in the first table this column is a primary key but in the second, another is chosen as a primary key... then does SQL treat the common column in the second table as just another ordinary column? Hence no optimization is present if the second table is searched based on the common column info, i.e. primary keys between two related tables are completely independent?  \n'
8698135	b' I would like to have a Referral model, where user A can refer an Event X to user B. The way I plan to implement it is without Referral Views. I just have a Refer button on a events/show page for create action, and have referred users in users/show page for show. I don\'t see the need to create a view for referral. \n\n From design pattern point of view, is it OK to create "refer" action in Events_Controller to invoke create method in Referral model, instead of sending it to a designated controller (i.e., Refferals_Controller), which will make call to Referral model? \n\n More generally, should I create controller to allow other controllers to interact with my model, even if I don\'t need any views for this particular model? \n\n Thank you. \n'
8698141	b" QML is a UI declarative language, extensively used for UI development. You cannot write too many or complex functionalities in QML itself. But you can have both JavaScript and QML in a single file. \n\n Let's say, if you want to stop an animation, for e.g., loading gif animation, after a time consuming process, just consider the following line of code. \n\n \n\n The above line of code can be called from the JavaScript file itself. If you still think that this feature is not sufficient, please tell us your use case.  \n"
8698144	b' Yes they are independent: primary keys are completely unique to  a table. \n\n They are not shared across tables, even if the type of the column is the same, but you can share the primary key of a table as foreign key in another table. \n\n No optimization is performed, as the second column you had mentioned is not a primary-key in that table. And the database by default creates an index based on a primary key which improves looking up in the table data. \n'

8698474	b' There is no way to force the browser to change direction.\nYou can, of course, write the sentence the other way around, and there are APIs out there that can get a meant-to-be RTL text, and produce an LTR text which its end result looks like a valid RTL sentence. \n\n Please note that some browsers, especially in RTL-language locations, get a browser which is RTL in the first place. That is, their title is RTL whatsoever. For the good and for the bad. So even if you apply an RTL-to-LTR hack as I described, those users will see it in reverse. \n'
8698476	b' I am asking because I have seen people say online along the lines of "joomla sucks because making a web app using joomla is hard due to poor API/architecture/docs/people on my lawn". Then these people talk about switching to drupal, ExpressionEngine or some other allegedly more webapp-friendly system. \n\n So, I thought about the following (naively, perhaps) straightforward approach to making a joomla based webapp of arbitrary complexity and power. First I write my app as a standalone php script. I identify all of the distinct pages/forms I have in it and I create corresponding "articles" in joomla. So maybe if I am making a "forum" webapp I would have a topic list "article", topic "article" and edit post "article". Now, instead of having these articles be relatively static pieces of text in joomla database editable by joomla\'s logic, I have my separate php script (the actual web app) directly output whatever html (or text, or smarty - whichever abstraction level is best) into the corresponding article text record inside joomla\'s database. Naturally, if there is a button called "submit" in that page, it would submit not to joomla but rather to my script, most likely via ajax, and then reload the (joomla) page which by that time will have already been updated by my script. \n\n So in a sense I have just gotten rid of the whole notion of "content" in joomla\'s CMS functionality and instead turned joomla into a shell or wrapper that displays pages from my script. Meanwhile I retain joomla\'s themes, nice admin panel, user management, media support, custom extensions etc. \n\n Ok, so so much for the n00b theory. Now, would anybody like to burst my bubble? Is there a good reason why people don\'t do it like that? Or shouldn\'t do it like that? Or is this in fact one of the well known ways of turning a CMS into a web app? \n'
8698479	b' If you create an instance level of a field, you are causing never-ending recursion, which ultimately ends up to StackOverFlow memory error. \n\n \nIf on the other hand you define your field as  static  you are avoiding the recursion, since the static field variables belong to the Class, not to the object instance. Classes in the JVM are only created once as opposed to Object instances, which can be numerous. \n'
8698491	b' Each "satellite" branch will have a main branch, correct?  So why not have a field "main branch".  If branch id == main branch, then it  is  a main branch.  Otherwise, it  refers  to the main branch. \n\n You should  not  have an "isMainbranch" column. \n\n "Branch type" column might be OK: types might include "main", "satellite", "ATM kiosk", etc.  But a boolean "isMainBranch"?  No.   \n\n IMHO... \n'

So, in your case it must be a problem with the version of jquery you are using. \n\n Please try Pure JavaScript Ajax call, and see if it works on all browsers.

8698713	b" The  layout_width  and  layout_height  properties of a view are intended to be used by its parent container. Some containers ignore one or both of these; most honor them. You need to consult the documentation of the container (in your case, SlidingDrawer) to understand how the values will be used. \n\n You don't show the complete main.xml, so it's hard to say exactly what's going wrong. It would also help if you posted an image of what's wrong. \n\n  EDIT  \n\n After seeing your complete layout, I think that the basic problem here is that you are using a LinearLayout to contain the SlidingDrawers. As the  docs for SlidingDrawer  note, they need to be in either a FrameLayout or a RelativeLayout (actually, any container that allows multiple views to sit on top of one another). \n\n Another possibility is that the second SlidingDrawer is being placed directly under the first one. Try changing the size of the second button (e.g., make the text longer) and see if it pokes out on either side of button 1. \n"

8698718	b' A column declared INTEGER PRIMARY KEY will autoincrement bydeafult. \n\n I stole it from  here : \n\n \n   Short answer: A column declared INTEGER PRIMARY KEY will\n  autoincrement. \n  \n   Here is the long answer: If you declare a column of a table to be\n  INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, then whenever you insert a NULL into that column\n  of the table, the NULL is automatically converted into an integer\n  which is one greater than the largest value of that column over all\n  other rows in the table, or 1 if the table is empty. (If the largest\n  possible integer key, 9223372036854775807, then an unused key value is\n  chosen at random.) For example, suppose you have a table like this: \n\n \n  \n   With this table, the statement \n\n \n  \n   is logically equivalent to saying: \n\n \n \n'

You may be thinking of a time when Adobe's SVG plugin was the only way to view SVG, but those days are long gone (and the plugin is defunct). These days, SVG is fairly well supported in browsers, at least for static images. Additionally, the SVG-related technologies that browsers support has been steadily increasing in all browsers over the past few years (it's a complex spec), and I see no reason why SVG support would stall or reverse. \n"

8698880	b" For me 'allow' should win from 'deny' when there are conflicting permissions. Generally you'll have roles spanning a broad feature set but with limited permissions (eg guest) towards roles with greater responsabilities.

An editor can do some things and is denied some others, for example permission X. Now if denying has precedence over allowing there will be no way of permitting Suman to do X. It is important to create roles for very specific privileges modifying a few general roles (guests, members), otherwise it will cut both ways (not being able to deny Suman a privilege you have given him through a role). \n \n"
8698885	b" In my application each of my users is required to select a suburb to which to associate their profile. The  users  table has a field  suburb_id  and a table called  suburbs  has both an  id  and  name  field. \n\n Our  suburbs  table contains most of the suburbs that we will need, however occasionally users will need to enter suburbs that we don't have in our table, or have popped up since we populated our table. \n\n What is the best way in terms of database design to solve this problem. \n\n I had considered changing the field  suburb_id  to just  suburb  and then testing in the application whether it was an integer or a string - if it was an integer the application would assume it is related to an item in the  suburbs  table, if it was a string it would assume otherwise. However, if a user was to simply enter an integer in the  suburb  field then the application would obviously mistake it and try to match it up with a value in the table. \n\n Is that an acceptable way to deal with the problem (it seems gimmicky to me - I am sure there must be a better solution). \n\n EDIT: I would also like to avoid inserting data provided from users into the  suburbs  table (even if flagged) as I don't want to affect the quality of the suburbs data we have. \n"
8698886	b" If you're not getting the textual values you expect, it's  possibly  down to the fact that you're using incorrect format specifiers (I'm assuming you've  populated  the variables you're trying to print here, though you may want to confirm this). \n\n  %llu  is explicitly for  unsigned long long int  which is not necessarily the same width as  uint64_t . \n\n In C99,  inttypes.h  has macros for the format specifiers to be used for the exact-width and -at-least-as-wide-as data types. \n\n For example: \n\n \n\n In this case,  PRIu64  means the  printf  format specifier, unsigned decimal output, for a 64-bit exact width variable. There are a wide variety of others for varying output types, plus equivalents for the  scanf  family as well (starting with  SCN ). \n\n Section  7.8.1 Macros for format specifiers  of C99 lists them in detail. \n\n \n\n Based on your update where you're not getting incorrect numbers but are rather getting what could only be described as rubbish, I would say your problems lie elsewhere. Even with corrupt pointers or data, I would not expect  fprintf  to generate non-numeric data for numeric format strings. It's certainly  possible  since it's undefined behaviour but very unlikely. \n\n You  could  get that sort of output for strings but that's not the case here. \n\n In other words, I think you have to look elsewhere in your code for (as an example) memory corruption issues. \n\n One thing you could do to test if the problem lies in the line you think it does, is to change it to: \n\n \n\n and see what comes out on the terminal. \n"

(this is bad also, since too much print messages in the code, makes it hard to see the algorithm sometime, it gets in the way, but can't remove it, since I might needs it later on). \n\n I find it amazing that such a powerful and flexible computational tool like M, still has a relatively less advanced development environment. When I am using Matlab, It takes me few seconds to find where a bug is, using the debugger. \n\n Someone might say use Workbench for debugging. I tried to use to debug a Manipulate demo, and I can't figure it out. Too complicated to use. M needs a simple easy to use debugger build-in (in the notebook itself, not a separate program), and with line numbers! \n\n Ok, Given the above introduction :), this is what I do myself in response to your question: \n\n \n  have different level of debug messages. coarse level, and detailed level. Coarse level prints only a message when it enters a function and when it exists the function.  \n  I have a button on the UI to use to turn on/off debugging (if you are doing UI based program, else it will be in the code).  \n  Use a separate debug function, where debugging message go through before being printed. In there, you can add time stamp to each message and such before printing (can also control if you want messages to go to text file, from one place). Rest of your code, just calls this debug function with the message to print. I print everything now to console, not to current notebook.  \n  Each debug message with have the function name that called it at its start.  \n  If you want to control debugging at the module level, what I do, it simply make a local debug flag inside the Module, and turn that on/off each time I want to debug that one specific module.  This local debug flag takes over the setting of the global debug flag. This way, I can debug just one module if I want, and not the rest of the code.  \n \n\n There are many other ways to customize all of this. But I found that if I spend more time early on to make a good debugging message system, it help allot in finding bugs when needed. \n\n Here are some useful link \n\n     \n\n workbench debugger (if you can figure how to use to debug Manipulate and Dynamics, please let me know) \n\n     \n"

8699280	b' It is possible, but the only way I can think off is far from being "clean and perfect".\n I would recommend to dig through Jackson documentation before using it, as a last measure . \n\n What you could do is to create a class with map field which will hold all properties of serialized object, like so: \n\n \n\n That way Jackson could parse such objects: \n\n \n\n Now, you still have undesired "map" wrapper, which would mess up deserialization. One solution could be to surround incoming JSON content with "{ map : " and closing tag "}". \n\n That way Jackson will properly map your object, you will have a map of all properties and you can iterate over it, get check type thanks to  instanceof  and retrieve all data. \n\n Once again, this might be not the best way to do it and you should try cleaner solutions first. I\'m not an expert on Jackson, so I cannot point you in a better direction. \n'

8699308	b" Depends on the application, of course. \n\n It does make much sense for a serial comm callback function to access OpenGL state, but if you're doing a prototype/proof-of-concept, why make your job harder? \n\n Shared memory is a good option; the callback can put the data somewhere, trigger the drawing thread and wait for it to finish. (And this is only one step away from the callback calling the drawing function itself.) \n\n Though I might prefer message passing. When the data is received, the callback can pack and send (copy) it to the drawing thread, who can draw it upon receival. This would have the added benefit of the UART code not waiting on the drawing code, though this is unlikely to be an issue given OpenGL's speed, especially compared to serial communication. \n"

8699635	b" I have been working on something similar for the last few months. I couldn't use Boost because the task was to serialize a bunch of existing classes (huge existing codebase) and it was inappropriate to have the classes inherit from the interface which had the serialize() virtual function (we did not want multiple inheritance). \n\n The approach taken had the following salient features: \n\n \n Create a helper class for each existing class, designated with the task of serializing that particular class, and make the helper class a friend of the class being serialized. This avoids introduction of inheritance in the class being serialized, and also allows the helper class access to private variables. \n Have each of the helper classes (let's call them 'serializers') register themselves into a global map. Each serializer class implements a clone() virtual function ('prototype' pattern), which allows one to retrieve a pointer to a serializer, given the name of the class, from this map. The name is obtained by using compiler-specific RTTI information. The registration into the global map is taken care of by instantiating static pointers and 'new'ing them, since static variables get created before the program starts. \n A special stream object was created (derived from  std::fstream ), that contained template functions to serialize non-pointer, pointer, and STL data types. The stream object could only be opened in read-only or write-only modes (by design), so the same serialize() function could be used to either read from the file or write into the file, depending on the mode in which the stream was opened. Thus, there is no chance of any mismatch in the order of reading versus writing of the class members. \n For every object being saved or restored, a unique tag (integer) was created based on the address of the variable and stored in a map. If the same address occurred again, only the tag was saved, not the deep-copied object itself. Thus, each object was deep copied only once into the file. \n \n\n A page on the web captures some of these ideas shared above:    . Hope that helps. \n"

8699887	b' Yes, since  \n\n \n a  Map&lt;String, String[]&gt;  is the most adapted data structure to store parameters \n  HttpServletRequest  has a  getParameterMap()  method. \n \n\n Note that this vulnerability has been fixed in recent versions of Tomcat. \n'
8699894	b'   Frequency   is simply the number of oscillations that a wave goes through per second. Any wave which is periodic has a frequency. But usually in music, use of the term is limited to talking about sine waves, so if you hear something about a wave of frequency x, it usually means a sine wave with that many oscillations per second. \n\n Any arbitrary wave, whether periodic or not, can be constructed by adding up sine waves of various frequencies in varying amounts (that is with various amplitudes). What the Fourier transform does is tell you which frequencies to use, and with which amplitudes, to create any given wave. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is a particular algorithm that computes the Fourier transform of a wave, given the data representing the amplitude of the wave as a function of time. \n\n When you hear a musical note played by an instrument, it doesn\'t consist of just a single frequency. Instead, what you get is a combination of different multiples of a fundamental frequency, in different amounts. For example, a flute playing a particular note might produce a combination of \n\n \n 440 Hz with amplitude 1 \n 1320 Hz with amplitude 1/2 \n 2200 Hz with amplitude 1/3 \n \n\n and so on. On the other hand, a trumpet playing the same note might produce a combination of  \n\n \n 440 Hz with amplitude 1 \n 880 Hz with amplitude 1/2 \n 1320 Hz with amplitude 1/4 \n 1760 Hz with amplitude 1/8 \n \n\n and so on. (Those are not the actual relative amplitudes for those instruments; I just made up some example numbers) So in your tuner application, when you run the FFT on incoming data, you will find multiple peaks in the output at various frequencies, depending on which instrument is being tuned. The point is that the output of the FFT will not just be a number; it won\'t just tell you "this instrument is playing a note at 440 Hz." \n\n Now we get to   pitch  , which is a slightly more nebulous concept. The pitch of a note is basically what a person actually hears when exposed to that note. For many instruments, the pitch is correlated to the fundamental frequency being emitted by the instrument. But depending on the relative amplitudes of the higher frequencies, a person might perceive two instruments to have different pitches even if they are actually playing the same note. \n\n Fortunately, if you\'re just making a simple tuner, you don\'t have to worry about pitch at all. The point of a tuner is to minimize beats between different instruments, and beats are caused by the actual frequencies, not the perceived pitches. A trumpet and a flute both playing with a fundamental frequency of 440 Hz will not exhibit beats because the differences between all their frequencies are multiples of 440 Hz, even if the untrained ear might think one of them is higher-pitched than the other. \n'

8700289	b" Preprocessor is run for each file before it is compiled, i.e. once for main_a.c and then again independently for shared.c. When shared.c is compiled MAIN_A is undefined. \n\n Preprocessor can't be used the way you're attempting, i.e. remembering state across compilation units. \n\n What you can do is define a name (for example  MAIN_A ) using the  -D compiler option in your Makefile and test this name using preprocessor the same way you're doing it now. This way the definition takes place on the project level (in the Makefile) rather than on a compilation unit level (in a .c file). \n"
8700303	b" jQuery is massive overkill. To answer your question, the javascript would be simply: \n\n \n\n Of course, that's out of context. So here's an example. \n\n \n\n The timeout is optional; it's there purely to demonstrate that the javascript is in fact moving the element. Other than that, there are a few things to note: \n\n \n The div is styled position:absolute. Besides making it easy to animate, this makes it far more efficient on more complex pages, since the targeted element's position doesn't affect the other elements on the page. \n You need to specify units. In this example I used 'px' - pixels. \n This is not applicable to this example, but if you are changing multiple values in the same frame then change them at the same time by setting el.style.cssText. If you don't do this then the browser may end up redrawing more than you want it to. \n \n\n To move the elements with arrow keys you would need to attach callbacks to the window.onkeydown event, like this. \n\n \n"

Currently in my unittests i'm building the response in code. But that's quit some work, especially when i need some variants in the different responses to test the different flows. Also the unittests become very large files. (Only building one response can be up to more than 200 lines) \n\n I have been thinking about a way to make it easier to build up the responses and make my unittests look more clean.  \n\n One option i have been thinking about is create for every unittest an XML file with the required response, deserialize this to the response and do my unittests on the deserialized object. \n\n The pro's of this method are that the unittests will become much smaller, and easier to create. But updating a file/element will be harder. Or at least that's what I think. \n\n Anyone has some thoughts or different options for making this response building easier? \n"

8700505	b" As far as I can see from your code, there are no  GetTareByBarcodeForm  instances in the  tareWeightList : the latter contains  String s, so when  bean:write  tries to extract the property, it cannot:  String  doesn't have such a getter.  \n\n Perhaps you should revisit your logic extracting the values, and wrap the results in proper instances. \n\n So your code should look more like the following: \n\n \n\n so that the result list, the one you pass as  TAREWEIGHT , would contain proper objects. \n\n Still, that's not too good: now,  GetTareByBarcodeForm  plays two roles, the actual form and the search result entry.

The only problem is that  plt.plot(x,y)  expects  x  to be a sequence of  x -values, and  y  to be a sequence of  y -values. \n\n We can use  zip  to convert the list of points into a list of x-values and  y-values: \n\n \n\n The use of the splat operator ( * ) in  zip  and  plt.plot  is  explained here . \n\n Thus we've managed to massage the data into the right form to be fed to  plt.plot .  \n"

8700549	b' I think what Lloyd meant is that you take your current code which is responsible for building your response objects and pack it in a separate *.dll so it is just an API or a library which you then can call from within your unit tests. Thus your unit tests will become much simpler.\nAnother benefit of this approach is that you could actually build two APIs: one constructing fake objects and another which queries the real service. Using an interface you could easily switch the APIs through a config setting.\nYou could also try to use a mocking framework like MoQ or smth. if it makes sense in your case. \n'

After the initial creation you can only do it by  ALTER  on the columns; changing the default character sets won't change the column.  \n  that your connection to the database is in UTF-8 encoding, by specifying  useUnicode=true  and  characterEncoding=UTF-8  properties in your connection string or properties. Ensure you have an up-to-date MySQL Connector as there have been grievous bugs here in the past.  \n  that nothing else in your processing stream is mangling the characters before they get to the database connection, or on the way back out.

8700654	b' You\'ve said you want to put a box or something on the page and move it around with arrow keys. So that breaks down into: \n\n \n Having an element to put on the page \n Being able to access that element \n Being able to set its position \n Capturing keyboard events \n \n\n 1 - Having an element to put on the page \n\n You can position an element on the page with full control over its location by making it an "absolutely positioned" element: Settings its  position  style property to  absolute : \n\n \n\n or better \n\n \n\n For that div to actually appear, you want to give it some size and probably some visible aspect: \n\n \n\n 2 - Being able to access the element \n\n Above we gave the element an  id . That means we can look it up using  document.getElementById . This isn\'t the only way to access an element, but it\'s simple and straightforward: \n\n \n\n 3 - Being able to set its position \n\n This is done with the  left ,  top ,  right , and  bottom  properties, which you can set via the  style  property on the element instance. Let\'s put it 10 pixels from the top of the page and 50 pixels from the left: \n\n \n\n Note that style values are always strings, and you must include the unit, just like in a stylesheet. \n\n 4 - Capturing keyboard events \n\n For arrow keys, your best bet is the  keydown  event, since it fires for non-printable keys (like arrows) and repeats if the key is held down. Here we get into one of the many places where a good library like  jQuery ,  Prototype ,  YUI ,  Closure , or  any of several others  can help you, because the best way to hook up an event handler is to use the DOM2 style of handler, but although Microsoft created them, when they were standardized the name and parameters were different from Microsoft\'s and Microsoft took a long time to support the standard. So you have to handle both Microsoft\'s way (  attachEvent  ) and the standard way (  addEventListener  ). Any good library provides a simple, unified way to hook up event handlers. \n\n  This answer  has a cross-browser  hookEvent  function we can use for this example (full source for it is in the final example at the bottom of this answer as well). We\'d use it like this: \n\n \n\n To find out what key was pressed, we use  keyCode  or  which &nbsp;&mdash; another cross-browser hassle that any decent library would handle for you. So: \n\n \n\n That sets  key  to  event.which  if it isn\'t falsey, and  event.keyCode  if  which  is falsey (via  JavaScript\'s Curiously Powerful  ||  operator ). All that\'s left is to handle the keys and move the element: \n\n \n\n There we\'re re-getting the element every time and we\'re parsing the existing  left  and  top  values out of the  style  property, which is fine as keyboard events don\'t happen all that often, but isn\'t necessary. Ideally you want to put all your code inside a "scoping function" so you don\'t create global symbols, and if we do that we can just get the element once and then use it in the event handler because the event handler we\'ll create will be a closure over the context of the scoping function (don\'t worry,  closures are not complicated ). Similarly we can use local variables within that scoping function to track  left  and  top . So: \n\n \n\n This code must be  after  the  &lt;div id="target"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  on the page, because it assumes that the element is already there. \n\n Bringing that all together \n\n Runnable live example *(you have to click the box to make sure that frame has focus before the keys will work): \n\n  \r\n \r\n  (function() {\r\n  // A cross-browser hook event function, tucked at the end to keep\r\n  // it out of the way\r\n  var hookEvent = makeHookEventFunction();\r\n\r\n  // Get the element, and our initial position\r\n  var element = document.getElementById("target"),\r\n    left = 0,\r\n    top = 0;\r\n\r\n  // Set the initial position on the element\r\n  element.style.left = left + "px";\r\n  element.style.top = top + "px";\r\n\r\n  // Handle the \'keydown\' event\r\n  hookEvent(document, "keydown", function(event) {\r\n    // Work with \'which\' or \'keyCode\', whichever the browser gives us\r\n    switch (event.which || event.keyCode) {\r\n      case 37: // Left\r\n        left = Math.max(0, left - 10);\r\n        break;\r\n      case 39: // Right\r\n        left += 10;\r\n        break;\r\n      case 38: // Up\r\n        top = Math.max(0, top - 10);\r\n        break;\r\n      case 40: // Down\r\n        top += 10;\r\n        break;\r\n      default:\r\n        // Not for us\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    // Update the element\'s position\r\n    element.style.left = left + "px";\r\n    element.style.top = top + "px";\r\n    \r\n    // Since we\'ve handled the key event, prevent it from\r\n    // propagating and prevent its default action\r\n    event.stopPropagation();\r\n    event.preventDefault();\r\n  });\r\n  \r\n  // ------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n  // A cross-browser "hook event" function, see my answer at\r\n  // https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23799296/js-li-tag-onclick-not-working-on-ie8/23799448#23799448\r\n  // for details.\r\n  function makeHookEventFunction() {\r\n    var div;\r\n\r\n    // The function we use on standard-compliant browsers\r\n    function standardHookEvent(element, eventName, handler) {\r\n      element.addEventListener(eventName, handler, false);\r\n      return element;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // The function we use on browsers with the previous Microsoft-specific mechanism\r\n    function oldIEHookEvent(element, eventName, handler) {\r\n      element.attachEvent("on" + eventName, function(e) {\r\n        e = e || window.event;\r\n        e.preventDefault = oldIEPreventDefault;\r\n        e.stopPropagation = oldIEStopPropagation;\r\n        handler.call(element, e);\r\n      });\r\n      return element;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Polyfill for preventDefault on old IE\r\n    function oldIEPreventDefault() {\r\n      this.returnValue = false;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Polyfill for stopPropagation on old IE\r\n    function oldIEStopPropagation() {\r\n      this.cancelBubble = true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Return the appropriate function; we don\'t rely on document.body\r\n    // here just in case someone wants to use this within the head\r\n    div = document.createElement(\'div\');\r\n    if (div.addEventListener) {\r\n      div = undefined;\r\n      return standardHookEvent;\r\n    }\r\n    if (div.attachEvent) {\r\n      div = undefined;\r\n      return oldIEHookEvent;\r\n    }\r\n    throw "Neither modern event mechanism (addEventListener nor attachEvent) is supported by this browser.";\r\n  }\r\n\r\n})();  \r\n  #target {\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  width: 10px;\r\n  /* Or whatever */\r\n  height: 10px;\r\n  /* Or whatever */\r\n  border: 1px solid black;\r\n  background-color: #ddd;\r\n}  \r\n  &lt;div id="target"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  \r\n \r\n \r\n \n\n Some references: \n\n \n  DOM2 Core  \n  DOM2 HTML  \n  DOM3 Core  \n  HTML5 Specification  \n ECMAScript (JavaScript) specification:  Official PDF  |  Handy HTML version  \n  Mozilla\'s JavaScript pages  \n  JavaScript: The Definitive Guide  by David Flanagan \n  Crockford on JavaScript  - Probably not right at first, but definitely read him at some point.

8700860	b" We have a couple of helpers like that in our project, but most of them are in our custom gem.

So application calls helper method (sometimes without any parameters at all) that forms required parameters and locals and passes them to partial. \n\n But when you're just rendering partial inside your application and you don't need any extensive logic around that rendering I don't think there's much use from creating new helper for every partial. \n"

8700970	b' I am using  mysql_query  +  mysql_store_result  +  mysql_fetch_row  to iterate over the fetched data.  \n\n The problem is that the latter returns an array of strings, even if all the data is numeric. So, I reckon, there is some kind of a numeric-to-string conversion going on when I fetch the records. \n\n Is it possible to fetch the binary data directly? Like a binary record blob and let me to extract the column values from there? \n\n Thanks. \n\n  EDIT  \n\n I would like to clarify myself. I am not looking for ways to efficiently convert strings to numerics. I am looking for efficient ways to read my numeric data from MySql tables using the MySql C API as defined here -    .

8701292	b' \n   I\'m trying to migrate graphics in my game to OpenGL for performance reasons. \n  \n   I need to draw an object using exact screen coordinates. Say a box 100x100 pixels in the center of 240x320 screen. \n \n\n For a perspective you also need some length for the lens, which determines the FOV. The FOV is the ratio of viewing plane distance to visible extents. In the case of the near plane it thus becomes  {left,right,top,bottom}/near . For the sake of simplicity we assume horizontal FOV and a symmetric projection i.e. \n\n \n\n or if you\'re more into angles \n\n \n\n For a 90\xc2\xb0 FOV the length of the lens is half the width of the focal plane. Your focal plane is 240x320 pixels, so 120 to the left and right and 160 to the top and bottom. OpenGL does not really have a focus, but we can say that the middle plane between near and far is the "focal". \n\n So let\'s say the object will have in average a extent of about the order of magnitude of visible plane limits, i.e. for a visible plane of 240x360, an object will have in average a size of ~200px. It thus makes sense the distance of near to far clipping to be 200, so +- 100 about the focal plane. So for a FOV of 90\xc2\xb0 the focal plane has distance \n\n \n\n 120, thus near and far clipping distances are 20 and 220. \n\n Last but not least the near clip plane limits must be scaled by near_distance/focal_distance = 20/120 \n\n So \n\n \n\n So this gives us the glFrustum parameters: \n\n \n\n And last but not least we must move the world origin into the "focal" plane \n\n \n\n \n   I need to rotate it around Z axis, preserving its size. \n \n\n done. \n\n \n   I need to rotate it around X axis, with perspective effect, preserving (or close to) its size.\n  I need to rotate it around Y axis, with perspective effect, preserving (or close to) its size. \n \n\n Perspective does not preserve size. That\'s what\'s makes it a perspective. You can use a very long lens, i.e. small FOV. \n\n Code Update \n\n As a general pro-tip: Do all OpenGL operations in the drawing handler. Don\'t set the projection in the reshape handler. It\'s ugly and as soon as you want to have some HUD or other kind of overlay you\'ll have to discard it anyway. So here\'s how to change it: \n\n \n'

Here are the steps that I did: \n\n DNN Setup \n\n \n Downloaded DNN using WebMatrix.  \n Launched DNN and proceeded with the installation wizard, which is basically just testing the environment and then creating the DNN database. \n After the wizard\'s installation launching DNN will now proceed to the Getting Started page \n Added "localhost/dnn" in the site alias list \n \n\n Moving to ISS \n\n \n In IIS I added application (folder) DNN in the web root \n I copied all the files from the original webmatrix path to the dnn folder in c:\\inetpub\\webroot making sure that the file/folder hierarchies are the same \n \n\n Result: \n\n When launching DNN using my browser I am directed to the installation wizard page instead of the Getting Started page. What am I missing? \n\n Thanks! \n'
8701359	b" Usually thread pools are used to implement such designs. They scale virtually infinitely for independent processes. You can find easy implementations in TBB and PPL. They offer concurrency-related versions of many Standard algorithms and containers. For example, in this sample I've used  concurrent_vector , which is a  vector -like container which can be safely mutated from several threads concurrently, and  parallel_for_each , which runs the function on many threads at once. \n\n \n"

8701376	b' I often need to decide between these two strategies for the object design: \n\n \n An object that is fully initialised and ready to use after its construction. The constructor often requires a complex list of parameters, hence the object initialisation is nontrivial. All objects having it as a member variable will also need nontrivial constructors. This may lead to code whose complexity is concentrated at object constructors, often making the code hard to follow. \n An object with default constructor. The object variables are set individually by means of  setter methods . This approach has the disadvantage that most methods need to check whether the object is fully initialized, hence complicating the code. \n \n\n What is your personal preference between the two, and how do you decide when to use one or the other? \n'

8701484	b' It\'s always good to initialize all your variables in the constructor, but to a default value. If it is difficult to get the value of the variable (for example, you have to call some function somewhere to get that value), you may set that value to an invalid one and then later you set the correct value. \n\n It is not a good idea to make the constructor so complex, because you can\'t return an error in the constructor (I don\'t know if it is ok to throw an exception in the constructor or not, because I particulary don\'t like trhowing exceptions anywhere). Also, you can\'t call virtual functions there, and so on. \n\n An approach I like when the construction of the class is complex is to create an "init" function. Then I can do something like: \n\n \n\n And so on. \n'

8701502	b' Neither.\nHuge parameter lists indicates the object does too much. Lots of properties that need to be set before the object can have a valid and useful output indicates it does too much.\nSo neither approach is a solution as far as I\'m concerned. \n\n There are lots of ways to break these things up, but outside of a specific scenario, the only rule is, "It needs doing". \n\n Aggregation into other objects, "controller" classes, various communicator patterns. Are some categories first class objects, can some be hidden in the implementation. \n\n I don\'t accept that the two options you present are the only ones, except possibly from a pragmatic point of view in terms of getting the code out of the door. Which one I was then forced to choose, would simply depend on how many calls to the constructor with different parameters the code required, versus how much validation would be needed to confirm all the properties were set, and possibly the impact on unit tests, which because the object is a mess would be unwieldy or limited. \n'

8701626	b' \n\n Hi, \n\n I am not sure how to get this working with xslt. The xml file has "Envelope" elements always in even number of occurences, the reason being, the xml will indicate us success, error or warning based on pairs(first and second, third and fourth etc). The top priority is for "criticalerror" element, that is, if this element is present in the pair, the pair is considered as error, the element can occur twice as well. \n\n The next priority goes to "milderror" element which stands for warning. The third priority goes to "success" element. Therefore only if both contains "success" in the pair, considered as success. \n\n For the above case first pair is success, second one is an error, third one is an error, fourth one is a warning. There are two errors, one success and one warning. This will produce an xml like below. Again, error is having higher priority(occurs first in xml), warning next \n\n \n\n Now I have a for each action with the above xml, for each paired scenarios(success, error and warning), there are three for each actions(that is how my design is ), which is an action in datapower \n\n Coming to my success for each action, I need to get the "ineed" element from the top xml, corresponding to the success pair, which is "apple", this can occur in either one or both, within a pair of top xml. It is same for a pair, however can occur in either one, or both. \n\n All I have is the context loopcount variable(1 in this case), for success, which is going to iterate for all success scenario \n\n Similary for error scenario(looping 2 times in this case), need to get the corresponding "ineed" element from top xml. Loopcount variable 1, next time loopcount variable is 2 \n\n Samething for warning scenario as well. \n'

8701644	b" This is because of the way Python resolves names with the  . .

8701726	b'  std::string  allocates through  std:allocator  (or a template parameter). Even if you could detach the raw storage, you\'d have to free it through  std::allocator  too. And you would of course want a RAII class to do that correctly. \n\n Fortunately, there already is just such a RAII class in the standard libraries. It\'s called  std::string . \n\n The closest thing to a "detach" function, therefore, is  swap . It detaches the resources from a string, and stores them in a form from which they can be correctly freed later (i.e., another string). In C++11, move assignment does that too. \n\n \n\n If your objective is to create for yourself the need to call  delete  on something, then (a) that\'s absurd, and hence (b) the standard libraries won\'t help you. Anyway, you\'d probably need  delete[]  rather than  delete . But since strings are not (directly) allocated with  new , it\'s not appropriate to think you can take their memory and free it (directly) with  delete[] . \n\n So, if your real situation is that you need to pass some pre-existing API a buffer that will be freed with  delete[] , then you\'ll have to take a copy, just as if you needed to pass some pre-existing API a buffer that will be freed with  free . \n'

8701728	b' Determining who or what is responsible for a particular piece of logic can be challenging.  Refactoring Ruby  and  Rails AntiPatterns  have been a huge help for me in sorting these types of problems out. If you think about the responsibility of the controller and each of the models, it doesn\'t really make sense that the controller should know if a user is an expert at a skill. If you can convince yourself that this logic belongs in the model, then it\'s a matter of which model it belongs in.  \n\n One might argue that it\'s the user\'s responsibility to know this, while another might argue that it\'s the skill\'s responsibility. Either way, moving it to one of those models will make your code easier to maintain and understand. \n\n Without knowing too much more about your code, it really comes down to which "feels right". I would probably say that this is the Skill model\'s responsibility and move the logic there: \n\n \n\n From your view: \n\n \n'

But I use some UTF-8 encoded .txt files that it seems not to be able to deal with that way and I need them! ie I have greek characters that should read...d\xcf\x83/d\xce\xa9... but currently read... d\xc3\x83/d\xc2\xa9... which isn't going to work ^^ \n\n So basically I need to make my Ant build work, baring in mind that it needs to be able to handle my UTF-8 encoded .txt files too. \n"
8701989	b' Maybe not entirely answering your question, but if using BMT you are also allowed to use resource local transaction managers.

8702048	b' ASP.NET has support for both a Viewstate and a Session state.  Here is a link to some info regarding session state. \n\n     \n\n I\'d recommend that you try to avoid using the viewstate at all, and use the session state sparingly.

Consider the following alternatives. \n\n       \n'

Your own server could then send the request to the external server, password supplied, and pass the response back to your user.  This is an extra hop, but you can keep the password completely secret. \n\n If you're asking your users for their passwords to another site, you need to be  extremely  careful with them.  In general, this sounds like a risky endeavor - you're exposing a lot of different ways to gain access to someone else's files.  The fewer of those you can create, the better.

The main purpose of the system is to query multiple databases and combine the information from the databases into a single response to the user.

It knows nothing else about your app.  It just alternates between the two functions you pass it each time you call it. \n\n When you reset the state of the popup without using Toggle, it gets out of sync as it now has no idea that you want to go back to the first state.  So, when you click again, it executes the second function when you want it to execute the first function. \n\n The best way to solve this problem is to use something smarter than Toggle.

You can't use Toggle because it isn't smart enough for your application. \n\n In working with your actual code, I also found that handling the mouseup event in the document is not very compatible with handling the click event in the object.

8702239	b' I have this code working when I build for debug on my phone and simulator (using iOS 4.0 on the simulator, and iOS 5.0 on my phone).  However, whenever I do an ad hoc build and install that on my phone, it acts as if the images save, but displays a blank area where the image should be.  So I don\'t think it\'s a permissions issue because I first check to see if there is an image file to display, and if not I display a default picture.  So if it were a permissions issue, it wouldn\'t be able to save a file name for the code to think there is a file to display, and would display the default.  Here is my current code: \n\n \n\n The UIAlertView is just in there so that I could see, in the ad hoc build, what was going on.  I had placed one in the if statement saving the image (where it says  NSLog(@"Not Saved!!!!"); ), as well as in the area to catch an error if the hotelsPath variable is not a directory that already exists (where it says  NSLog(@"%@",error); ).  The UIAlertView did not appear for those two areas. \n\n Again, this code works when I build from x-code directly onto my phone for debugging, but not when I archive with ad hoc and create an ipa file to place directly onto my phone.  I\'m pretty new to iPhone development, and do not understand the differences in the builds to know what it could even possibly be. \n\n  Edit  \n\n Here is the code checking if the file exists: \n\n \n\n I check to see if the database has a file name for the image, then check if the image exists, and download it if not while showing the default image for the time being. \n\n  Update  \n\n I added some code to check the file size of the file path.  Prior to saving the file, it is 0Kb.  After saving the file, the image I checked was 96,077Kb.  This was on my phone.  On the simulator, which is working fine, the file size is showing the same image to be 97,696Kb.  Could it be that the image is just not completely saving?  Or is there a type of compression on the iPhone? \n\n  File Path Example  \n\n Here is a path this application would check for: \n\n  /var/mobile/Applications/APP-NUMB3R-1D/Library/images/hotels/96.jpg  \n\n And again, the first time the hotel is looked at, it shows the default image because this file path is not found.  The next time, it shows a blank image, indicating that the file path was found.  Also, when I check the file path for it\'s content size, the first time it is zero.  The next time, it is around 100Kb.  So something is definitely being written.  And lastly, when I run this same code in debug mode on my actual phone, it works and displays the image.  When I run it with my ad hoc build, it does not show the image. \n\n  EDIT  \n\n There may be yet another problem.  I just found that after changing my code back, the images are NOT showing up after download on my iPhone with the debug build.  I must have changed something else in all the testing that I need to fix again.  A previous debug build on another phone here is still working correctly though, so at least I know I\'m not losing my mind. ;) \n\n I found this was because I had changed the variable names for my file path.  Changed them back and it worked again. \n'

8702311	b' It should be possible to do using jQuery ajax. Javascript in a Firefox extension is not subject to the cross-origin restriction. Here are some tips for using jQuery in a Firefox extension: \n\n \n  Add the jQuery library to your extension\'s chrome/content/ directory.  \n  Load jQuery in the window load event callback rather than including it in your browser overlay XUL. Otherwise it can cause conflicts (e.g. clobbers a user\'s customized toolbar). \n\n  \n  Use "jQuery" instead of "$". I experienced weird behavior when using $ instead of jQuery (a conflict of some kind I suppose)  \n  Use jQuery(content.document) instead of jQuery(document) to access a page\'s DOM. In a Firefox extension "document" refers to the browser\'s XUL whereas "content.document" refers to the page\'s DOM.  \n \n\n I wrote a Firefox extension for getting bookmarks from my friend\'s bookmark site. It uses jQuery to fetch my bookmarks in a JSON response from his service, then creates a menu of those bookmarks so that I can easily access them.

[...]  \n  \n   Without quotes, local-parts may consist of any combination of\n     alphabetic characters, digits, or any of the special characters \n\n \n \n\n But you could just strip out the plus part if you insist. \n\n  $emails = array(\'bob@gmail.com\',\'bob+1@gmail.com\',\'bob+hello@gmail.com\');\n\nforeach ($emails as &amp;$email)\n{\n    list($identifier, $domain) = explode(\'@\',$email);\n    list($name) = explode(\'+\',$identifier);\n    $email = $name."@".$domain;\n}\n\nprint_r($emails);\n  \n\n The above will give you \n\n \n'

8702688	b' As Purmou mentioned, none of these methods will work because Joomla uses the same index.php from the template so every page on the site will include the CSS class or ID if you code it in there. \n\n Lucky for you, Joomla took this in to account and you can easily do what you are trying to do with a simple mod to your template. Joomla uses what is called the page class suffix to allow you to make page specific CSS. Any time you create a menu item, you have an option to include a page class suffix which will only be added to pages within that menu item. In order to put that suffix in the body tag so you can achieve what you are trying to do, add this code to your index.php in your template: \n\n \n\n If you add a page class suffix to a menu item, it will be inserted as the body tag ID. If you don\'t it will use "default" instead. This way you can control the ID of the body on a per page basis and male changes specific to every page on the site. \n'

8702693	b" You can load the driver class via reflection as mentioned by BalusC, after that you can use DriverManager to get a connection. Then you stick to the java.sql or javax.sql interfaces and you should be good to go. \n\n If you intend for this code to be used by any sort of web application, this approach will work, but it will have severe drawbacks. This approach interferes with application reloading, and this is a  huge  pain during development. \n\n If you expect to use this in a web application, you should make it an option to retrieve your database connections from a data source. This way the web container is the one that actually loads the driver, and your application doesn't pay the penalty for being the one that loaded the driver class.  \n\n Your database library code just needs to use the data source API to retrieve the connection and then the java[x].sql interfaces to manipulate the database. So its only a difference in the way that a database connection is retrieved. \n"

8702702	b" Cake follows the 'Convention over Configuration' methodology. It's a framework that can be used to rapidly prototype and deploy (mostly) CRUD based applications. It's got a lot of 'magic' happening behind the scenes which don't always make it a good choice if you don't know what's going on under the hood.  \n\n As to your specific example, it isn't too bad. Recipe actually refers to a  Recipe  model that the  User  model is related to. Cake has an inbuilt ORM that uses some model variables to set your model relations properly. This would be the case in any ORM framework, I'd say. Unless you changed the class name, you wouldn't need to change all the references, this would be true in any PHP code. \n\n As to other framework recommendations. I'd suggest that you work with your own PHP MVC stack before you begin to work with frameworks. If you have a fair understanding of PHP, you could look at the  CodeIgniter  or  Kohona  framework. These are less rigid than Cake. You could also have a look at the  Zend Framework . There are many other frameworks out there that have different features (more or less with differing variations of control offered), all you need to do is look around.  \n"

8702737	b' A number of answers say that you must call Dispose. Though those answers mean well, they won\'t actually help you. You are calling Close, and Close and Dispose do the same thing. It is a  better  practice to use a "using" block so that you get Dispose called for you automatically, but your code is fine as it is. \n\n The real answer to your question is "stop worrying about it". You are thinking about this at the wrong level. I assume that you are looking at either "working set" or "private bytes" in the task manager, but you might not understand what those actual means. Most people do not. This answer gives a good summary: \n\n  What is private bytes, virtual bytes, working set?  \n\n OK, now that you know what "private bytes" are, it should be more clear why this is not a problem. Suppose you are the CLR garbage collector. You allocate a bunch of memory on behalf of the user and use it to store managed objects. Every now and then, the garbage collector runs, compacting the objects in memory and marking the memory formerly used by now-dead objects as available.  But why would the GC return all those blocks of memory to the operating system?   The GC has evidence that you are the sort of person who writes programs who use that much memory, so it keeps the empty pages around so that it does not have to incur the expense of allocating them again later when you use that much memory again two milliseconds from now. \n\n So, stop worrying about it. Everything is probably fine. Using 500 million bytes of memory is not a problem. If you start getting low on virtual memory, the GC will likely start decommitting the unused pages. If it doesn\'t -- if that keeps growing without bound, then start worrying. \n\n If you\'re still worried, use the right tool for the job. "Private bytes" tells you very little about what is actually happening with memory in your program.  If you want to know what is really happening in the garbage collector then you need to use a managed memory profiler.  It will give you a report of exactly what is going on. \n'

8702800	b"  The Scenario \nI have my main application which was originally written in Borland C++ that is being started by a C# .Net application.  This main application occasionally opens a modal dialog from a process called BRWSEXE.  After a modal dialog window pops up, you could accidentally click somewhere in the main application (not on the dialog) causing the focus to briefly change to the main application sending the modal dialog behind it in the Z order.  But you can't actually do anything on the main application, it is locked up by that modal dialog window that must close first before you can continue. \n\n  The Problem \nUsing the .net application that launches everything, I can seek out instances of BRWSEXE that are related to the main application and force them into the foreground.  This tactic works flawlessly everywhere I've tested it so far (Windows xp, Windows 7, Windows Server 2003 R2) but it doesn't work on Windows Server 2008.

8702937	b' I am not a professional web-developer but I am designing one to help out a no-profit organization.\nI spent a couple of days searching the web for instructions and explanations on css, float, position, etc. Finally I managed to design the layout I wanted with the behaviour I wanted but there is still something that is not working/I do not understand.\nPlease, see the page at: "http://www.missione-berna.ch/index2.php" and its source; I put all the code in it to make it accessible (at the end stiles, scripts, menu and header will be in separate files included eventually via php).\nHow come that my "Menu" div is neither the size of its content nor the size of the neighbour "Contenuto" div?\nI understood that it is not an easy task to have the height of two div column match, but where is this "mid-way" size coming from?\nAny help appreciated, thansk in advance. \n'
8702943	b' Sure, this is possible: \nCreate one Quartz.Net Job to poll for the  VODContent  (there are  other ways then polling for other DBMS  but this is a simple solution which works for mysql since the mysqlconnector doesn\'t feature event notification as far as I know). In order to create such a job, you have to implement the  IJob interface  of Quartz.Net as  described here  and your program has to schedule it to run every n-seconds/minutes which is also described in the tutorial. \n\n A short tutorial which shows how to connect to, read from and write to a mysql database via the  mysql connector  can  be found here . \n\n How to find out if you already started a job for a specific  VODContent  depends. You could, for example, modify the specific Row and introduce a new bool value "Processed" which gets updated upon scheduling the specific job. You then have to query only for those values which are not yet processed. \n\n Please read the parts about statefull vs. stateless jobs in Quartz.Net and be sure to understand the difference. \n\n That job created above would then check for changes in the table and schedule a new job which in turn runs your desired process / code according to your rules using the  simple trigger  instruction as described in the tutorial. \n'

8702959	b" A constructor is called everytime you create an object of type  Main_Class ,  or one of its subclasses . \n\n Since you're creating  new  objects of a subtype during this creation, you run into an infinite loop that ends when memory is exhausted or the memory limit is reached: \n\n \n\n Instead, you should create the objects in a  static  method. But even if you do, note that your goal violates the important principle of  encapsulation  and will lead to an extremely poor design. Instead, you probably want to have methods that operate on an arbitrary object of type  Main_Class , and override the methods (i.e. have a method  test  in every one of these classes). \n"

8702975	b' First of all,  position: absolute  can be a Very Bad Thing. Avoid it unless trying to take elements out of the flow of the page (having one element appear on top of another). \n\n Second,  height: 100%  does not do what, intuitively, you\'d think it does. You\'re setting the height of the menu div to 100% of the  viewport\'s  height (your browser window), not 100% of the entire  page . \n\n Since your menu has a simple background, there\'s a neat trick you can use to make it appear to be the same height.  CSSDesk  \n\n I\'ve added a wrapper div around your menu and content. Relevant bits of HTML: \n\n \n\n And styled it like so: \n\n \n\n So the entire thing has a gray background. Your menu is floated left (over the gray background). The contentuo div has a left margin of 192px to "clear" the menu, and has a white background to hide the gray. The wrapper and content divs, and thus the gray/white backgrounds, will expand to the size of your content. \n\n A couple tips: \n\n \n Be careful with  height: 100% . \n  float: left  or  float: right \ninherently set  display: block . You can\'t set  display: inline  on\nfloated elements. \n \n'
8702992	b' Your assessment is correct, doing so is wrong.  You must encode text .   :raw  is for binary data , e.g. images. If you find UTF-8 unsuitable, perhaps you were looking for the encodings ISO-8859-8 or Windows-1255 instead. \n\n Read     to learn about the topic of encoding in Perl. \n'
8703007	b' Your last call to  getline  leaves  linea  empty. With an empty line as input,  split  will return an empty vector (the test  length() &gt; 0  will be false). Trying to dereference the first element ( lSeparada[0] ) then invokes undefined behaviour. \n\n Maybe the input file does not contain an empty line, but the last call to  getline()  will fail. You should test  whether the  istream&amp;  returned by  std::getline()  is good  with  while(getline(entrada,linea))  instead of  while(entrada.good()) getline(entrada,linea) . This might solve your problem. \n'

8703128	b' A simpler approach would be to just split the first array into N equal (or near-equal) parts (with 8 cores, n=8 seems reasonable).  Then solve the program in the "normal" way, by looking if any hashes in the 2nd array are present in the N smaller sub-first-arrays.  This can be done in parallel. \n\n That said, I\'ve never heard of tries/dawgs before and I found the main discussion fascinating and informative.  (I mainly work with numbers, not words) \n\n This assumes that the byte[] hashes are of some finite, shortish length so that you really can split up the original file to process in parallel.  Is that the case? \n\n EDIT ADDED \n\n For an example of this idea, see  GPU Graphics Gems , edited by Wen-Mei W. Hwu, chapter 11, an article by Ligowski, Rudnicki, Liu and Schmidt.  They parallelize a massive protein sequence database search by splitting the huge single database into many smaller pieces, then run the  normal algorithm  on each subpiece.  I like this quote.  "The described algorithm is embarrassingly parallel".  In their case they used CUDA and had to do a lot of memory optimization, but the principle should still apply to multi-core machines. \n\n semi-PSEUDOCODE FOLLOWS.  I\'ll use Lists for the incoming byte[] hashes, hope that\'s o.k. \n\n Original, 1 core method \n\n \n\n New method.  Uses exact same process method (later on).  No DAWGS or TRIES here... \n\n \n'

Examples: Maybe you access the site via localhost/ on your dev environment, but you access to test site via test.Ronald.com? test.Ronald.com would be your PortalAlias \n  \n If your test server runs off the same database server as your dev server, it sounds like you need to open up access in firewalls so that your test server has connectivity to your dev database \n  \n \n\n  A word of advice  \n\n Once you get it running,  you will be making changes to each database separately (assuming your test site and dev site use different DB Servers). This sync issue can be a royal pain with DNN, as your page structures, module assignments, html module contents, installed modules/extensions will get out of sync.

Eat is  how  a cookie you eat a cookie. It should not be concerned with  when  you should eat it. A less contrived example would be a query service that determines if it should call an implementation that uses a local storage, or call an implementation that makes a network call for specific queries.

How would using a DynamicProxy interceptor in cases like these be advantageous for code maintenance? \n\n \n"

8703665	b' Maybe this is because a shared access signature cannot be for more than one hour. In order to have a more than one hour SAS, you need to use container level policy (that you can revoke)\nExcerpt from  article  \n\n \n   One way that you can manage a Shared Access Signature is to control\n  its lifetime by ensuring that it expires within an hour. If you want\n  to continue to grant a client access to the blob after that time\n  period, you must issue a new signature. This is the behavior of a\n  Shared Access Signature that is not associated with a container-level\n  access policy. A Shared Access Signature not bound to a\n  container-level access policy cannot be revoked. If a start time is\n  specified, the expiration time must be 60 or fewer minutes from the\n  start time, or the signature is invalid and cannot be used. If no\n  start time is specified, the signature is valid only during the 60\n  minute period before the expiration time. This policy is intended to\n  minimize risk to a storage account in the event that the signature is\n  leaked.  \n  \n   Another way to manage a Shared Access Signature is to associate the\n  signature with a container-level access policy. The container-level\n  access policy is represented by the signedidentifier field on the URL.\n  A container-level access policy provides an additional measure of\n  control over one or more Shared Access Signatures, including the\n  ability to revoke the signature if needed. \n \n'

Now, when i wanted to switch back to Android i'm unable to. \nIn new project there's no option for creating a new Android project nor even a Java project.\nEven i tried to change the Preference window to Java or Java Browsing but anything didn't work. Now i'm unable to run or compile even a single java file even after changing the perspective.

8703840	b" The median is actually found by sorting the array first, so in your example, the median is found by arranging the numbers as 2 8 9 10 20 39 and the median would be the mean of the two middle elements, (9+10)/2 = 9.5, which doesn't help you at all. Using the median is sort of an ideal situation, but would work if the array were at least already partially sorted, I think.  \n\n With an even numbered array, you can't find an exact pivot point, so I believe you can use either of the middle numbers. It'll throw off the efficiency a bit, but not substantially unless you always ended up sorting even arrays. \n"

8703887	b' This seems impossible but I will ask anyway.\nHere is the scenario \n\n I have a MVC 3 View that loads 3 partial views, one for login, one for registration, and one for OpenID logins. \n\n The first 2 work great with Ajax, however; the third view uses ajax to post to my openid controller where I go do some DotNetOpenAuth magic \n\n Example: \n\n \n\n I am doing a redirect from the returned Json from the controller the OpenId Login form posts to, "remember this post is via ajax". So after the redirect I would like to replace the contents of the div with the initial openid login partial view with a new view based on what happens after the redirect to the provider, the user signs in, and I get a response back in my actionMethod. For instance, I will check in my database to see if I already have an account for that open id. If I don\'t I would like to present a partial view to the user with some basic questions etc.. and let them add the open id account.  \n\n So it seems that this is not possible since the redirect kills any chance of getting data back to the original page. \n\n Any ideas? \n\n Process bullets as requested: \n\n \n Main View renders a partial view with a form \n Form inside partial view does ajax post to an ActionMethod in a controller \n ActionMethod in the controller returns Json with a redirectUrl \n OnSuccess callback function reads json result and does a client side redirect to the redirectUrl \n User logs in to openid provider at redirected location \n OpenId provider sends results back to the same ActionMethod that generated the initial Json redirectUrl result \n Perform DB lookup on open Id and return partial view if user not found or log user in if found. \n \n\n I would like to have the view id the user is not found get loaded in the original div the login form was in. This doesn\'t work. \n'
8703894	b' You are linking a static library (the Boost one) into a dynamic library. Static libraries are not typically built with -fPIC, as they are assumed to be linked into a program only, not another library. \n\n On 32 bit x86, such code is silently fixed up by relocating the portions of the code that are not position-independent to the load address; this makes the affected pages unshareable. For this to work, the relocation entry needs to be converted from a link time to a run time relocation. \n\n This conversion fails on x86 64 bit; the two error messages mean \n\n \n The relocation is applied to a 32 bit value, but the displacement may be larger than that (shared libraries live at random addresses for security reasons, which places them wide apart on 64 bit platforms,  and  \n for this reason, there is no dynamic relocation type corresponding to the relocation entry from the static library. \n \n\n Thus, the linker cannot generate code that would be loadable, and rightfully refuses to do so. \n\n To solve this problem, you need to link against the shared  libboost_test_exec_monitor-mt , or build a static library yourself. \n'
8703897	b' If you use fixed table layout in the technical sense, i.e. have the CSS declaration  table-layout: fixed , then the first row determines the column widths and any width settings for cells in other rows will be ignored. (This may result in truncation of cell contexts\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the idea of fixed layout.) \n\n Otherwise, the width requirements of all cells are taken into account by the browser when it calculates column widths. So if you have  width=100  in a cell in the header row but another cell in the same content has content that requires 200 pixels at the minimum, that width will be used and your setting for the first-row cell will be ignored. \n'

8703911	b' A dynamic proxy can be useful for implementing aspects of behaviour that apply across a complete system or sub-system. If you had 15 services each with 20 methods that need the same behaviour applied to them (security check, remoting, logging, ..., or sniffing - as in your example) then a dynamic proxy can be used to implement the behaviour once. Using delegation you can achieve the same result but with much more boilerplate code (300 times more using my numbers.) \n\n Repetitive boilerplate code increases the amount of maintenance work involved in making a change, and makes certain types of structural change much more expensive (and less likely to happen.) \n\n Dynamic proxies also have some disadvantages - the code is more complicated than for (a single use of) delegation. There can also be differences in performance characteristics that mean a trade-off needs to be made between performance and maintainability in those rare cases where the performance overhead is significant.  \n'

8704049	b" My basic Java problem is this: I need to read in a file by chunks, then reverse the order of the chunks, then write that out to a new file.  My first (naive) attempt followed this approach: \n\n \n read a chunk from the file. \n reverse the bytes of the chunk \n push the bytes one at a time to the front of a results list \n repeat for all chunks \n write result list to new file. \n \n\n So this is basically a very stupid and slow way to solve the problem, but generates the correct output that I am looking for.  To try to improve the situation, I change to this algorithm: \n\n \n read a chunk from the file \n push that chunk onto the front of a list of arrays \n repeat for all chunks \n foreach chunk, write to new file \n \n\n And to my mind, that produces the same output.  except it doesn't and I am quite confused. The first chunk in the result file matches with both methods, but the rest of the file is completely different. \n\n Here is the meat of the Java code I am using: \n\n \n\n At     you can see a complete example program (a long with my debugging attempts). For simplicity I am using a bufferSize that divides evenly the size of the file so all chunks will be the same size, but this won't hold in the real world.  My question is, WHY don't these two methods generate the same output?  It's driving me crazy because I can't grok it. \n"

8704261	b' This is really limited to what the app server itself will allow; i.e. if it explicitly supports replacing the transaction manager. \n\n The real art to transaction management is the container registering transactional resources (DataSource connections, JMS Sessions, JPA EntityManagers, etc) with the TransactionManager via wrapping them with  Synchronization  objects and registering them with the current transaction via either the  Transaction  or the  TransactionSynchronizationRegistry  \n\n The container implements the  Synchronization  objects, the TransactionManager implements the  Transaction  and  TransactionSynchronizationRegistry  objects.  The coordination between the two is what gives you actual management when a transaction is running. \n\n BMT and CMT are just alternate ways to tell the container to start/stop transactions.  In some regards the term "Bean-Managed" is false as the  UserTransaction  in every compliant app server will be implemented by the container and thus it is still the container doing the work.  As well "Container-Managed" is slightly misleading as it is still the bean developer deciding when transactions are started/stopped, it\'s just done declaratively vs programmatically.  The most accurate description of these features would be Programmatically-Managed Transactions and Declaratively-Managed Transactions.  In all cases it is still the bean talking with the container and the container and transaction manager doing all the work. \n\n All that said it may still be possible for you to change the transaction manager, OpenEJB and TomEE support it, however it will not work in the way you are attempting.  Check with your vender to see if this is possible. \n'

8704374	b" You're interpreting SQL &amp; PHP wrong. Given: \n\n \n\n (A) What's in the database \n(B) What you're trying to find in the database \n\n Since you're tryign to insert a PHP variable into the query string, you must have defined that variable elsewhere in your PHP code. Remember that while an SQL database and PHP can talk with each other, they must do so in each other's language. You can't send PHP code to a database and expect the database to execute it. That's not the database's job. The database interprets SQL queries and nothing else. \n\n Similarly, when the database returns data back to PHP, the database driver must convert from the database-specific blob/text/date/enum fields into PHP versions. It's not PHP's job to try to interpret the database data formats. \n"

8704406	b' With PHP  alone , I don\'t think it\'s possible. However, it\'s likely that your webserver is running Apache, which makes this task  fairly  straightforward by transforming your pretty URLs into ugly URLs (with query strings) that your PHP script can handle. Your visitors have no idea this is happening; they aren\'t redirected or anything. \n\n I strongly recommend you take a look at  this tutorial , and its  followup . The second tutorial contains the information you need for this task (starting in  this section ), but I strongly recommend reading the first tutorial to gain a deeper understanding of what you\'re doing. \n\n Essentially, those tutorials will teach you how to specify (ugly, scary-looking) URL-rewriting rules in a file called  .htaccess . These rules will transform (or "rewrite") your pretty URLs into less pretty ones that your PHP script can handle. \n\n For example,  yoursite.com/about  would actually be accessing  yoursite.com/index.php?page=about , or something along those lines. \n\n For some sample code, here\'s a snippet 95% copied and pasted from  this tutorial : \n\n \n\n As that link explains, it will forward all requests to index.php, unless an actual file or directory is being requested. \n'

This counter really is not that helpful because it is often unclear how much of it is physical and also the CPU cost of each of these accesses is unknown.

8704788	b" Multidimensional arrays in C are arrays of arrays. The elements of an n-dimensional array are (n-1) dimensional arrays.  A[0] , for example, is an  int [3] . \n\n \n\n In certain contexts, an array is converted to a pointer to the first element of the array, but the array is not itself a pointer. \n\n From the C standard, \xc2\xa7 6.5.2.1-3: \n\n \n   3 Successive subscript operators designate an element of a multidimensional array object. If  E  is an n-dimensional array (n\xe2\x89\xa52) with dimensions i\xc3\x97 j\xc3\x97...\xc3\x97k, then  E  (used as other than an lvalue) is converted to a pointer to an (n \xe2\x88\x92 1)-dimensional array with dimensions j \xc3\x97 . . . \xc3\x97 k. If the unary * operator is applied to this pointer explicitly, or implicitly as a result of subscripting, the result is the pointed-to (n \xe2\x88\x92 1)-dimensional array, which itself is converted into a pointer if used as other than an lvalue. It follows from this that arrays are stored in row-major order (last subscript varies fastest). \n  \n   4 EXAMPLE Consider the array object defined by the declaration \n\n \n  \n   Here x is a 3 \xc3\x97 5 array of ints; more precisely, x is an array of three element objects, each of which is an array of five ints. In the expression  x[i] , which is equivalent to  (*((x)+(i))) , x is first converted to a pointer to the initial array of five ints. Then i is adjusted according to the type of x, which conceptually entails multiplying i by the size of the object to which the pointer points, namely an array of five int objects. The results are added and indirection is applied to yield an array of five ints. When used in the expression  x[i][j] , that array is in turn converted to a pointer to the first of the ints, so  x[i][j]  yields an int. \n \n\n To create a  ptr_array  as diagrammed: \n\n \n\n Here's how to work out the declaration. From the diagram, ptr_array is an array of size 2.  \n\n \n\n The elements of the array are pointers \n\n \n\n to arrays of size 3 \n\n \n\n of ints \n\n \n\n If you're ever not certain how to declare something like this, you can use  cdecl : \n\n \n\n You can install a command line version of cdecl (if not already installed) on your development computer. The exact method depends on the platform. Check the documentation and web at large. \n"
8704791	b' Yes. You can declare an array to be of anything you like. \n\n Your declaration \n\n \n\n defines a two-dimensional array of ints, of size 2x3.  A[0]  is a pointer to  the start of  an array of 3 ints, as is  A[1] .  A[0][0]  is the first element in the first array.  A[1][2]  is the last element of the last array. \n'

8704870	b" 1) Having separate databases allows for easier distribution of load on several hosts, it lifts the roof in many ways; disk, memory, locking, cpu, backup-time and so on. If you are serious about putting millions of rows in mysql, it is certainly a good idea with separate databases (not only schemas), and even separate instances, so that the resource-consuming customers won't impose downtime on less resource consuming ones.  \n\n 2) It is going to be exactly N times harder to manage where N is the number of databases :o) This extra cost you must compare to the cost of using just one db/schema and instead manage separation of customer in code. It's also inherently much harder to manage if you have to call customer support at your hosting company, or even your local grumpy dba, instead of just running a neat script from your console each time you need to update schema or create a new database. \n\n Some databases and persistence frameworks have support for multi-tenancy, Oracle has this and support is beginning to emerge in Hibernate 4. \n\n Even though many arguments point in the direction of separate databases, it  is  generally possible to use just one database as well.  \n"
8704872	b" This can be a tricky one to work out and it can get very messy very fast.  \n\n I would suggest you stick with your current approach of having only one timer which is initialised in the main viewmodel. You then have to ask yourself the question - does the age (TimeSinceStart) of the Widget belong on the Widget, or is it purely for display/informational purposes? Is it a core piece of information that each Widget must keep during its lifespan? \n\n This looks to me like it is for display purposes only. So my suggestion is this: once you have called  GetWidgets , you could enumerate through each Widget and wrap it in a thin viewmodel of its own. The constructor for that viewmodel takes two parameters - the timer from the main viewmodel, and the Widget. You then subscribe to the timer's  Tick  event, and from that you notify that the  TimeSinceStart  property has changed.  \n\n \n\n Wrapping a DTO (entity, Data Transfer Object) with its own viewmodel is a quite common approach when adding functionality to an entity. If you use this appoach you will have to slightly modify any UI bindings that were targetting properties on the Widget, as those UI elements will now be dealing with a WidgetWrapper (or you can just surface the required properties in the WidgetWrapper itself, then no bindings have to change). \n"

8704891	b' I don\'t find that inter-table relationships are the main limiter for scalability.  I use queries with joins regularly and get good scalability if indexes are defined well. \n\n The greater limiter for scalability is the cost of synchronous I/O.  The requirements of consistency and durability -- that the DBMS  actually  and reliably saves data when it tells you it saved data -- is expensive. \n\n Several NoSQL products that are currently in vogue achieve great performance by weakening their consistency and durability guarantees in their default configuration.  There are many reports of CouchDB or MongoDB losing data. \n\n There are ways you can configure those NoSQL products to be more strict about durability, but then you sacrifice their impressive performance numbers. \n\n Likewise, you can make an SQL database achieve high performance like the NoSQL products, by disabling the default features that ensure data safety.

8704982	b' Edit, in response to comment: \n\n The way reservoir sampling  should  work is:  you want to select exactly the right proportion of samples from each of the existing bins in order to make up an additional bin with the same probability.  In your  sample()  loop, given that you have randomly sampled one of  item  bins, you need to select samples from  each  bin with probability  1/(item + 1) . \n\n However, with  fixed() , both the selection decision and the previous bin number depend on the same fixed 32-bit number.  This means that the likelihood that a sample is removed from each of the bins will not be uniform. \n\n \n\n Consider what happens during the third iteration of the  sample()  loop.  You have three existing bins (0, 1, and 2), and you want to pick 1/4 of the samples in each and add them to a newly created bin 3. \n\n Note that all the 32-bit  fixed()  numbers in bin 1 will be even (because the first pass selected all numbers divisible by 2), and all the numbers in bin 0 will be odd (because the even ones were moved to bin 1).  The second pass moves all numbers divisible by three to bin 2 (which should be OK so far, and does not change the even/odd division in bins 0 and 1). \n\n The third pass then moves all  fixed()  numbers divisible by 4 into bin 3.  But, this will select half the numbers from bin 1 (because half of all even numbers are divisible by 4), and none of the numbers from bin 0 (because they are all odd).  So, even though the expected size of the new bin should be correct, the expected sizes of the old bins are no longer the same. \n\n That is how  fixed()  generates an uneven distribution: the implicit assumption, that you can select an exact fraction of each bin by choosing a random number, is violated if that number depends in a predictable way on the numbers used to choose the original bin. \n\n \n\n The basic property of random numbers is that each sample must be independently distributed from the preceding samples, in a statistical sense.  Algorithms based on random numbers depend on this property. \n\n Pseudo-random number generators (PRNG\'s) are not actually random; as you know, their results are actually a fixed sequence.  The PRNG results are deliberately scrambled so that they act enough like actual random numbers for most purposes.  However, if the PRNG is "weak" for a particular application, the inner workings of the PRNG can interact with the details of the application in odd ways, to very non-random results. \n\n What you\'re trying out here, by re-using the same random number, is building a bad PRNG.  The actual results depend on the details of how the application  uses  the random numbers... \n\n Even though  fixed()  is an intentionally broken PRNG, many commercial library PRNG\'s are "weak", and can end up with similar weird interactions with some applications.  As a practical matter, "weakness" is relative to the application -- and, while there are statistical tests that are widely used to try to expose weak PRNG\'s, there is no guarantee that your application won\'t stumble on some odd correlation of even a "strong" PRNG. \n'

I can still create and access new accounts, but can no longer access any of the previously registered ones. \n\n I have checked the database and confirmed that they are all still there. My initial thought was an incorrect password. I've checked two accounts that I knew the password for and both are inaccessable. I attempted to use the password recovery option, but when I type in the username I'm told that the user does not exist. \n\n When I check the databases and consult both the membership and profile tables, the old and new users, pre and post regex change, are all in the same table.

The starting point is a custom  pow  function: \n\n \n\n After inspecting the range of my input, I chose  int64  because it is big enough to represent output and I can avoid expensive calculation with  bigint : \n\n \n\n I assume that modulo ( m ) is bigger than multipliers ( a ,  b ) and functions work on non-negative numbers only.  The  powMod  function is correct for most cases; however, the problem lies in the  mulMod  function where  a*b  may be over  int64  range but  (a*b)%m  is not . \nThe below example demonstrates the overflow issue: \n\n \n\n  Is there any way to avoid  int64  overflow without resorting to  bigint  type?  \n"
8705447	b" To address your 'how you can guarantee all products are in the cache' point first, I think it's a completely valid criticism. When I've done demos of the tagging feature, I've loaded all the products into the cache when the application starts, tagging them appropriately - it's the only reliable approach I've come up with.  \n\n In terms of what tagging is useful for, I see it as giving you extra options for retrieving items from the cache. Remember that you can assign an  IEnumerable&lt;DataCacheTag&gt;  to each cached item, so to follow through with the products example, as well as the category you could tag each item with the supplier, or with things that go  across  the set of product categories such as 'FreeDelivery' or 'LowStock'.  \n\n Or depending on how you present it to the user, you could  drill into  a set of products, building up a set of tags to search the cache for e.g. begin with 'Menswear', then add 'Knitwear', then 'Colour:Black', then 'Size:L', showing a narrower set of products to the user with each tag added to the search. \n"

Setting PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES to false and then trying to use another database will fail. \n \n\n I just did some tests and I don\'t see that happening. Changing the database only happens on the server, and it does not change anything about PDO\'s configuration in the client. Here\'s an example: \n\n \n\n If what you\'re saying is true, then this should work without error. PDO can use a given named parameter more than once only if PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES is true. So if you\'re saying that this attribute is set to true as a side effect of changing databases, then it should work.  \n\n But it doesn\'t work -- it gets an error "Invalid parameter number" which indicates that non-emulated prepared statements remains in effect. \n'

8705578	b' I have some code where I am trying to use variables in a tabpage. The first tabpage only has one text box for user entry (miles.text) and a button to do a calculation: traveltime = mileage/speed. The value from miles.text is stored into a variable called mileage while the speed used is stored in a variable called speed (me.speedtextbox.text).  \n\n Ordinarily, doing val(variable.text) works like a charm and it\'s not doing it in this case. When the user enters 100 for the mileage, it should be divided by 65 (the number in the database) and, therefore, the answer should be 1.53 hours. In my case, I\'m getting "infinity" and whenever I do anything else with the variable, I get "when casting from a number, the value must be a number less than infinity." But it is! It\'s only 65 and I double-checked that the dataset said that too, which it does. Not sure why I am getting this error...thank you! \n\n \n\n So I did a test program where it did only one thing and that was to simply read one data column in a one row database and store it to a local variable and multiply it by 1.60  except now I am getting "reference to a non-shared member requires an object reference" and it doesn\'t seem to recognize Me.Speed when I declare it.

8705606	b" It seems that the cost you're seeing is the class-loading cost: the first time the code accesses a class, the class-loader loads its binary (.class file) into memory. This is a one time cost that for most practical purposes is negligible. \n\n Moreover: \n\n \n   Now, if I write ... inside a loop in the code, I find that there is a cost overhead the first time the code is called, \n \n\n How did you measure this cost? It is nearly impossible to measure the time cost of a single operation. You can measure the time needed to carry out xM passes thru a loop and then you can divide to get the amortized cost. However, measuring a single operation is difficult: you may be getting a Garbage Collection cycle, a thread-related context switch, etc. Moreover, the JIT (Just In Time) Compiler does not kick the first time a statement is executed, so measuring a single operation will usually give you a much higher cost than amortized cost over N operations. \n\n FWIW, I would write  getLocs()  as follows: \n\n \n\n Alternatively, you can use replace the SightSensor enum with a variable of type EnumMap: \n\n \n\n Then,  getLocs()  calls simply become  map.get(dir)  \n"

8705706	b" Let's take a look at how constant assignment works internally. The code that follows is extracted from a source tarball of ruby-1.9.3-p0. First we look at the definition of the VM instruction  setconstant  (which is used to assign constants): \n\n \n\n No chance to place a hook in  vm_check_if_namespace  or  INC_VM_STATE_VERSION  here. So we look at  rb_const_set  ( variable.c:1886 ), the function that is called everytime a constant is assigned: \n\n \n\n I removed all the code that was not even called the first time a constant was assigned inside a module. I then looked into all the functions called by this one and didn't find a single point where we could place a hook from Ruby code. This means the hard truth is, unless I missed something, that there is  no  way to hook a constant assignment (at least in MRI). \n\n  Update  \n\n To clarify: The anonymous class does  not  magically get a new name as soon as it is assigned (as noted correctly in Andrew's answer). Rather, the constant name along with the object ID of the class is stored in Ruby's internal constant lookup table. If, after that, the name of the class is requested, it can now be resolved to a proper name (and not just  Class:0xXXXXXXXX... ).  \n\n So the best you can do to react to this assignment is to check the  name  of the class in a loop of a background worker thread until it is non- nil  (which is a huge waste of resources, IMHO). \n"

8705916	b"  See update below  \n\n I think I came to a pure CSS3 solution, involving 3d transformation: you can look a  webkit only  demo here:     \n\n basically, the idea behind this demo is starting from a basic element displacement, floating both wrapper and children elements - I used  &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;  for the sake of simplicity and made a  clear:left  starting form  li:nth-child(2n+1)  -  in this way: \n\n \n\n then I rotateZ the  ul  so that the whole list is rotated by -90deg and then repositioned with translateX/Y for the right alignment.  \n\n But also list items will be rotated: so an inverse Z-rotation is applied to every  &lt;li&gt; . Another rotation of  180deg  along X-axis is also necessary to give list-items the correct order. Even in this case some adjustments with X|Y translation is needed \n\n The result is  \n\n \n\n In 3rd revision of the fiddle   3/  you can see how to adjust some properties on the list so that the elements before and after are correctly positioned. \n\n Note: this demo is working only on webkit. For a list of browser supporting 3D-transforms look at     \n\n  Update  \n\n I've done further experiment: if you apply a  float:right  (instead of  float:left ) to each  &lt;li&gt;  3D Transformations are no longer needed (because elements are already in the right order by row when  &lt;ul&gt;  is rotated) and the css rules are greatly simplified \n\n \n\n so this fork  \n\n     \n\n has an increased support (surprisingly even more respect CSS3  *-columns  usage), since it works even on Firefox 3.5, Opera 10.5 and probably MSIE 9 (I haven't tested this) :     .  \n\n For older IE consider to serve an alternative style (via conditional comments) or some kind of js/activeX effect using  Matrix Filter  \n"

8705933	b' The first example demonstrates the use of a  flexible array member , a feature of C99. However in order to get that snippet to compile, you need to have another member in your  struct , ie: \n\n \n\n  This documentation  on gcc tells you why  sizeof  evaulates to zero, and the syntactical difference of a normal array: \n\n \n   In ISO C90, you would have to give contents a length of 1, which means\n  either you waste space or complicate the argument to malloc. \n  \n   In ISO C99, you would use a flexible array member, which is slightly\n  different in syntax and semantics: \n  \n   \n   Flexible array members are written as contents[] without the 0. \n   Flexible array members have incomplete type, and so the sizeof operator may not be applied. As a quirk of the original implementation\n  of zero-length arrays, sizeof evaluates to zero. \n   Flexible array members may only appear as the last member of a struct that is otherwise non-empty. \n   A structure containing a flexible array member, or a union containing such a structure (possibly recursively), may not be a\n  member of a structure or an element of an array.

It would be an initial append animation, which would mean when the page first loaded it will animate. You can do this using  @keyframes , and set it so that the image you want slides into place from a starting position of where it would be. But, again, this will happen on first load as well. You can fake it by 'spinning into place' for the first load. So, have all images spin once on load. \n"

8706148	b" The error is in  createIntObject , where you return a pointer to a function parameter: \n\n \n\n Accessing pointers to local variables (including the function parameters) once the function has returned yields undefined behavior.

8706181	b" I have made solutions that work with scroll and non-scroll views using keyboard notification and a detection of the current first responder, but sometimes I use this trivial solution instead: The simple way is to detect the opening keyboard via the text field delegate's  textViewDidBeginEditing:  method and to move the entire view up.  The easiest way to do this is with something along the lines of changing  self.view.bounds.origin.y  to -100 (or whatever).  Use the corresponding  textViewShouldEndEditing:  method to set it to the opposite, which is 100 in this case.  Changing  bounds  is a relative procedure.

8706335	b' I\'m rather new to Rails and simply love it\'s expressive modeling architecture. I\'m currently building a routing system with a one to many link between two tables.  \n\n Consider the following schema: \n\n \n\n Now consider the following data for a single trip: \n\n \n\n What I\'d like to do is show a list of all trip Name along with the Location of first and last PitStop in a single "trip" row for the \'trips/index\' view. I don\'t care about the pit stops in between, I just want to know where I started and where I ended:  \n\n \n\n I\'d like to eliminate all the "in-between" PitStops from the query, as there will be quite a few for each Trip. \n\n  Question : What is the best way to pull this data from the db using ActiveRecord?  \n\n Solution: Jan. 3rd, 2012 \n\n I solved my problem by applying my PitStop logic to the Trip model. My From and To PitStops now have hard coded stop_number values. After working through it, I found that the solution actually makes sense for the real world as well (double win). \n\n \n The  From  PitStop record will always have a stop_number value of 0. \n The  To  PitStop record will always have a stop_number value of 99. \n \n\n This makes sense because the first PitStop isn\'t really a "pit stop" at all, it\'s where you start from (ie. 0). The last PitStop isn\'t really a "pit stop" either, it\'s your end location (ie. 99). Of course this assumes that no route will ever have more than 98 "pit stops". :) Safe assumption for me... \n\n These logically defined "stop_numbers" also solve my problem for querying all child PitStops for the \'trips/index\' display, and I can query these values quickly and effectively per trip (no more sub queries for  .first  or  .last ): \n\n \n\n As you see, the trick to entering the  stop_numbers  is now a simple math equation after defining your  starting_from  and  ending_at  records (now a logical business rule). Now I can simply say: \n\n \n\n My (ordered) PitStop records now look like this:  \n\n \n\n Very elegant in my opinion. Thanks  @clyfe  for the tip! \n'

Automated tools exist for generating clients and servers for popular languages, but you could write your own tool or hand-code your own implementation. \n\n If you are the only person working on a web service, using an abstraction like WSDL may seem like a waste. In a team-oriented environment where many people and possibly several teams are working on services the WSDL abstraction makes it far easier for people to work together. \n"

8706639	b' Production code SHOULD NOT raise notices. This causes scroll blindness - you get used to having a lot of meaningless messages, so you don\'t notice the important one (until it\'s too late). \n\n Random comments: \n\n \n it\'s not really important how you avoid notices, in your case it might be initializing $errorsArray to an empty array; \n holding errors in an array like that is probably not the best idea anyway. Now you have two styles of passing data to your view: one by global variables ($name, $password), one by values indexed by numbers ($errorsArray[0], $errorsArray[1]). The first one is better, the second one is OK, and you could think of some better ones ($data[\'name\'][\'errors\']). But the general rule is: stick to one way of doing things. As an old Polish saying goes: "mo\xc5\xbce by\xc4\x87 chujowo, byle jednakowo" (roughly translated: might not be the best way, but at least it\'s uniform).  \n \n'

8707522	b" \n\n So I have checked your code and found the problem.  Do the following: \n\n \n Go into your storyboard and select the Master Table View (click where it says Static Content) \n Click on the Attributes Inspector (looks like a downward arrow sort of) and change the content from  Static Cells  to  Dynamic Prototypes  \n Click on the prototype cell and type  Cell  into Identifier field (this is what you are using as a cell ID \n Also change the Accessory from  None  to  Disclosure Indicator  \n In your  tableView:numberOfRowsInSection  return  self.harvestRecipeList.count  \n  In  tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:  you can remove the following two lines (as they are provided by the Storyboard): \n\n cell = [[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifier:CellIdentifier];\ncell.accessoryType = UITableViewCellAccessoryDisclosureIndicator;  \n  Recreate your Push segue from your Master Cell to your Detail View Controller  \n \n\n It should all now work fine - and I've tested that it works.  The basic problem was you had specified Static Cells rather than Dynamic Prototypes and the rest of the instructions are just mopping up.  The NSRangeException was caused by only having a single cell so that was all that was displayed. \n\n Hope this helps. \n\n \n\n So, a few comments but, first, if you've updated your code can you post an update? \n\n \n Your  harvestRecipeList  that you add objects to in  ViewDidLoad  does not appear to be the same  harvestRecipeList  that you synthesised - it will be local to the method so your instance variable will always be nil.  You should always use  self.harvestRecipeList  - do this everywhere.  This could easily explain your  NSRangeException .  Also see #4 below. \n In your  tableView:numberOfRowsInSection:  you should return  self.harvestRecipeList.count  \n If you are using the iOS5 SDK, you do not need to check if  cell == nil  as  dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:  is guaranteed to return non-nil cell.  You do need to check if you are on the iOS4 SDK. \n Change your  @synthesize harvestRecipeList;  to  @synthesize harvestRecipeList = _harvestRecipeList;  as this will assist with #1 and checking you are accessing the ivar. \n \n\n Try  #1  &amp;  #2  as a minimum and then post an update on the problems you are having.  Hope this helps. \n"
8707598	b" Here is an implementation based on Boost Spirit. \n\n Because Boost Spirit generates  recursive descent  parsers based on  expression templates , honouring the 'idiosyncratic' (sic) precedence rules (as mentioned by others) is quite tedious.

8707841	b' Disk I/O demand varies tremendously based on many factors, including: \n\n \n How much data is already in RAM \n Structure of your schema (indexes, row width, data types, triggers, etc) \n Nature of your queries (joins, multiple single-row vs. row range, etc) \n Data access methodology (ORM vs. set-oriented, single command vs. batching) \n Ratio of reads vs. writes \n Disk (database, table, index) fragmentation status \n Use of SSDs vs. rotating media \n \n\n For those reasons, the best way to estimate production disk load is usually by building a small prototype and benchmarking it. Use a copy of production data if you can; otherwise, use a data generation tool to build a similarly sized DB. \n\n With the sample data in place, build a simple benchmark app that produces a mix of the types of queries you\'re expecting. Scale memory size if you need to. \n\n Measure the results with Windows performance counters. The most useful stats are for the Physical Disk: time per transfer, transfers per second, queue depth, etc. \n\n You can then apply some heuristics (also known as "experience") to those results and extrapolate them to a first-cut estimate for production I/O requirements. \n\n If you absolutely can\'t build a prototype, then it\'s possible to make some educated guesses based on initial measurements, but it still takes work. For starters, turn on statistics: \n\n \n\n Before you run a test query, clear the RAM cache: \n\n \n\n Then, run your query, and look at physical reads + read-ahead reads to see the physical disk I/O demand. Repeat in some mix without clearing the RAM cache first to get an idea of how much caching will help. \n\n Having said that, I would recommend against using IOPS alone as a target. I realize that SAN vendors and IT managers seem to  love  IOPS, but they are a very misleading measure of disk subsystem performance. As an example, there can be a 40:1 difference in deliverable IOPS when you switch from sequential I/O to random. \n'

8708037	b' I\'m not familiar with the Oracle terminology, but for SQL Server the question is worded in a way that\'s confusing. To clarify: \n\n \n A clustered index determines the physical order of the table \n A nonclustered index is basically a copy of the main table, ordered by the assigned keys \n You can assign ("include") additional columns in the nonclustered index, which can allow the query optimizer to use those columns to satisfy queries, rather that doing a bookmark lookup. \n A heap is a table without an index of any kind. All queries to a heap require a scan. \n A full nonclustered index scan is faster than a full table scan, provided that the index is narrower than the table and that you don\'t need bookmark lookups. \n \n\n So, with that in mind, keys used for joins should usually have either a clustered or a nonclustered index associated with them, to avoid table scans. You can include additional columns in your nonclustered indexes as needed -- and prefer clustered indexes for queries that cover a contiguous range of key values with access to many columns per row. \n'

You can check in a  config.example.php  with the most common settings, and document in the  README  that users have to copy it to  config.php  and then edit it.  \n  Put any shared settings in  config.php , and add an include statement to point to an unversioned file with settings specific to the machine, e.g.  config.local.php . You can also provide an  config.local.example.php -file for this.  \n  Like 2, but the  config.php  contains all default settings and the local file has the ability to override them.  \n  Check in a  config.dev.php  and  config.server.php -file containing the settings for both environments, and then have an unversioned  config.php  which includes one of the above files. Advantage is that the configurations themselves are versioned and you can update them.  \n \n\n Which of these variations to pick, or whether you make another variation, depends on your environment. \n'

8714553	b' My personal rule-of-thumb is to create two-table associative entities as index-organized-tables, with the primary key constraint being the access "direction" I expect to be more commonly used.  I\'ll then generally add a unique index to cover reverse order of the keys, so in all cases the optimizer should be able to use unique-scan or range-scan access. \n\n Three-table (or more) associative entities generally require significantly more analysis. \n\n Also, the optimizer will use indexes with hash join operations; generally fast full scans, but indexes nonetheless. \n'

8714903	b' You are encountering this dilemma because you have adopted the rather non-standard approach of allowing access to resources by default.  The far more standard approach is to prevent access by default, grant access via one or more "allow" ACL entries, and override any "allow" entries via even a single "deny" entry.  Under this approach, any given "deny" entry trumps all "allow" entries.  (i.e.: The application should look for denies first and, if it finds any, it doesn\'t even need to check for allows.) \n\n If you need convincing that the "prevent by default" is a better model than "allow by default", here are a few major differences: \n\n \n  It is generally a better fit for the mental model of permissions\nmanagement held by most permission administrators, whether they be\nIT staff or business-role application administrators.  (Granted,\nthis is at least partly due to the fact that most other systems they\nwill have administered use this model, but that doesn\'t make it any\nless relevant.)  \n  Human error is less likely to result in inappropriate granting of a\npermission.  (i.e.: If the administrator forgets to add an "allow"\nentry under prevent-by-default, no user ends up being able to access\nresources that he should not have been able to touch.)  \n  When a new permission is added to the system, nobody without special\nadmin rights can access the target resource(s) until explicit\n"allow" entries are added.  \n \n\n #3 is particularly compelling.  Imagine you deploy a new version of an HR application with a new "view salaries" permission.  Would you find it acceptable to allow all users to be granted this permission until someone gets around to adding "deny" entries to your ACLs? \n'
8715015	b' Well, I guess you could call it my own stupidity, but the behavior is kind of non intuitive. \n\n In case anyone else implements INSTEAD OF triggers to enable updatable views via EF, it should be noted that the implementation described here:  error when inserting into table having instead of trigger from entity data framework  should ONLY be used for the INSTEAD OF INSERT trigger, NOT the INSTEAD OF UPDATE trigger.

8716061	b" My feeling is that by doing what you asked, you are not using Quartz to its full potential. \n\n An easier way to achieve what you want to do would be that each time you create an entry in VODContent, you also create a trigger scheduled at  StreamAt + 5  minutes. This should be done at the level of your applicative code, in the process that is adding the entry in VODContent. \n\n The trigger you create must have a name and a group (so that you can retrieve it at a later point). In your case, I believe the name could be the Id of your VODContent line. Here is how you create such a trigger: \n\n \n\n Then, if at some point you want to cancel the execution of your trigger (let's say for example that you remove an entry in VODContent because your user cancelled his order), you can call the UnscheduleJob on the Scheduler in order to remove your trigger: \n\n \n\n One last important thing is that your Quartz.NET instance should be configured to AdoJobStore, and not the RAMJobStore. That way, your triggers will be stored in a database, and even if the scheduler is stopped/restarted, you won't lose your scheduled triggers. \n\n Basically, you should try to put yourself in a position where you  push  to Quartz, instead of having Quartz pull from your application. \n"
8717077	b' If your goal is to do speech recognition from an html page, you might want to look at some other alternatives. Chrome supports speech recognition for text input.

Opera implemented a different solution, but it appears they are no longer supporting it -    .  \n\n Another approach that has been used is to use a java applet or flash app that communicates with a speech recognition back end. WAMI is a good example of this -    . These approaches use a rich client (Java or Flash or other plug in) to capture speech and send it to a server or some local speech engine for processing. \n'
8717128	b' A generic solution for multiple sub-keys: \n\n \n\n This lets you pass the primary key and a hash of sub keys and fields to aggregate by. \n'
8717203	b' The only real advantages of delegates over interfaces are \n\n  Delegates could deal with different argument types even before .Net supported generics.\n A class can create delegates exposing multiple different methods sharing the same signature; replacing delegates with interfaces would mean that every class could expose one method that implemented each delegate-style interface without creating helper classes, but would need a helper class for each additional implementation.\n \n\n When .net did not support generics, delegates were essential part of it since declaring distinct non-generic interfaces for each and every different function signature one would want to pass would have been unworkable.  If .net had supported generics from the beginning, delegates would not have been necessary except for certain scenarios involving Reflection, and even there it would perhaps have been most useful to have the type  Action&lt;T,U&gt;  be an implementation of  IAction&lt;T,U&gt;  (so that code which simply needs something it can  Invoke  would use the interface).  An interface-based approach would have required the creation of single-method classes in cases where classes need to create delegates exposing multiple methods, but would have eliminated the need to create separate delegate instances in the many common cases where the number of methods of a given signature to be exposed is precisely one. \n\n Incidentally, replacing delegates with interfaces would in no way prevent the creation of a general-purpose Combine method.  Indeed, interface covariance could make such a method work better than the existing  Delegate.Combine  in many respects.  Implementing a method analogous to  Delegate.Remove  would be at best clunky and annoying, but I can think of no situation other than event subscription management which would require the use of  Delegate.Remove , and event subscription could best be handled using other approaches anyway. \n'

I suspect that the performance penalty for using bigints should be acceptable for most applications (compared to the headache of maintaining your own math routines). \n"

8729190	b" A full page redirect destroys the original page, so no, you can't have a subsequent redirect bring the user back to the original page with only one  &lt;DIV&gt;  updated.   \n\n You have at least two alternatives: \n\n \n  Simply take the full page redirect, and when the authentication result comes back from the Provider your MVC controller re-renders the entire original page.  Downside: the controller can't restore any user-specific state from the other views that were previously there.  \n  Use a popup window to log the user in, and when the login has completed the popup closes itself, passing back the authentication data to the parent page which can then re-render whatever portion it wants.  \n \n\n DotNetOpenAuth supports both approaches, but of course there is plenty of code in the controller and view, external to the library, that you have to write.

8732495	b' I think the pros/cons of using RDBMS or NoSQL really depends on the data and how you plan to use it. It is my understanding that transactions are actually represented quite well with a relational DB. My experience with NoSql is with Infinite Graph &amp; Neo4J. Forensics is a good use case for NoSQL, each person is an node/vertex and an edge can represent different types of communication (email, phone, face to face meeting, carrier pigeon, etc...). You can then take a suspect/vertex and traverse the graph with specific criteria to find how two seemingly unconnected individuals are actually connected (probably with more efficiency than a traditional relational DB). Social graph data is another good example, every user is a node/vertex and the relationship(friend) is an edge connecting two nodes. In short, is your data best represented &amp; retrieved with tables or nodes/edges. \n'

8738150	b' The input to  UIImageJPEGRepresentation  is a 2-D array of pixels, not the compressed data from which that 2-D array was created.  (The array might not have come from compressed data at all!)   UIImageJPEGRepresentation  doesn\'t know anything about where the image came from, and it doesn\'t have any concept of the "quality" of its input.  It just knows that you want it to try very hard to make the output small (when  compressionQuality  is zero) or you want it to try very hard to make the output accurate (when  compressionQuality  is one). \n\n The JPEG compression algorithm has some tunable parameters.  The  compressionQuality  value selects a set of those parameters.  When you set  compressionQuality  to 1, the compressor uses a set of parameters that allow very little loss of accuracy of the input data, regardless of what that input data actually is.  For  any  input data, those parameters result in very little loss of accuracy.  The tradeoff is that those parameters also result in very little compression.  The compressor doesn\'t then think "Hmm, I should try using other parameters and see if I get the same accuracy with better compression".  If that\'s what you want, you have to do it yourself. \n'

9391359	b' Pitch and frequency measure exactly the same quantity, but on different scales.   \n\n Frequency is generally measured in Hertz, which counts the number of times per second that the vibrating object goes through a complete period of its vibration.  For example, if the frequency is 440 Hertz, then the object goes through 440 complete periods of its vibration every second. \n\n Pitch is generally measured in octaves, semitones and cents - a cent is a 1/100 of a semitone, and a semitone is 1/12 of an octave.  It\'s not normally expressed as a numeric quantity, but instead, with letters and symbols.  That\'s because there\'s no "zero point" as such, for pitch.   \n\n Because pitch and frequency measure the same thing, you can convert freely between them - rather like converting between temperatures expressed in Fahrenheit and in Celsius.  The algorithm is a little complicated though - to work out a pitch, you need to take the DIFFERENCE between the base-2 logarithm of the frequency, and the base-2 logarithm of a frequency corresponding to a known pitch.  The most commonly used value for this known pitch is "A above middle C" - it corresponds to a frequency of exactly 440 Hertz. \n\n This conversion is best demonstrated with an example.  Suppose I want to find the pitch corresponding to a frequency of 1000 Hertz.  The base-2 logarithm of 1000 is 9.9657842847.  The base-2 logarithm of 440 is 8.7813597135.  The difference is 1.1844245711; which tells me that the pitch corresponding to 1000 Hertz is 1.1844245711 octaves above "A above middle C".  Multiply this by 12 to give an answer in semitones - it\'s 14.21309485 semitones.  Now 14 semitones above "A above middle C" is the "B" almost 2 octaves above middle C.  The pitch that we\'re looking for is therefore 21.309485 cents above this "B". \n\n The letter names are a bit confusing, because sometimes you go up 2 semitones to get to the next letter (so B is 2 semitones above A), and sometimes just 1 (so C is 1 semitone above B).  They also repeat every octave (so 2 semitones above G isn\'t H, it\'s A).  Musicians find this easy to deal with; the rest of us find it horribly confusing. \n\n Now, when you play a single note on a musical instrument, the sound wave that you get has multiple frequencies, which you can find out with a Fourier analysis.  The lowest frequency is called the "fundamental frequency", and the other frequencies are usually integer multiples of this frequency (which are called "harmonics" or "overtones").  So, if you play "A above middle C" on a piano, you\'ll get a composite sound, made up of a frequency of 440Hz, a frequency of 880Hz, a frequency of 1320Hz and so on - there could be dozens of these individual frequencies that make up your sound, all of them integer multiples of 440Hz.  Now most musicians listening to this won\'t distinguish individual sounds for each frequency, so when a musician uses the word "pitch", they\'re normally referring to the pitch of the fundamental frequency ("A above middle C"), because that\'s the only pitch that is actually distinguishable.   \n\n If you\'re building a tuner, this is the definition of "pitch" that you will want to use; that is, your tuner should only display the pitches that a musician who hears the sound can actually distinguish.  This means that after you\'ve done a Fourier analysis, you need to remove these higher frequencies, before you calculate the pitches.  I think (but I\'m not sure about this part) that once you\'ve got your set of frequencies from your Fourier analysis, you\'ll need to remove any frequencies that \n\n \n are an integer multiple, or very close to an integer multiple, of a lower frequency in the set \n have a notably lower amplitude than that lower frequency - but I\'m not sure how much lower the amplitude has to be, before the higher pitch disappears into inaudibility (and it probably varies from one hearer to another). \n \n\n To give another example, suppose I have a sound which includes frequencies of 262Hz, 440Hz, 524Hz, 786Hz, 880Hz, 1048Hz and 1320Hz, and the amplitude of each frequency is much greater than the amplitude of the frequency above.  I notice that all the frequencies are multiples of 262Hz or 440Hz.  So I conclude that this sound has just two "fundamental frequencies", and therefore consists of just two musical notes, or just two pitches (roughly middle C and the A above).  The higher pitches are certainly components of the sound, but they are harmonics.  The harmonics won\'t be audible to anyone hearing the sound; and therefore should not be displayed by your tuner. \n\n To that extent, pitch as perceived by a musician is a psychological effect, which makes it hard to model in an electronic tuner.  You may have to do some experimentation, to work out exactly when a higher pitch should be considered a separate note, and when it should be considered a harmonic.  Also, many musicians will be able to hear pitches that the Fourier analysis doesn\'t pick up (summation tones and difference tones) - their hearing really does play tricks. \n'

9875176	b' The frameworks I tend to lean toward are Lithium and CakePHP. \n\n Lithium is built from the ground up to be PHP 5.3+ native - so it is WICKED fast and insanely efficient. Objectively, I definitely prefer it over Cake, Zend, Symfony, Yii, etc. Also, Lithium was created by the guys responsible for Cake\'s very existence (it started out as Cake3, but was so different that it split off into it\'s own project entirely). \n\n The one area where Lithium sort of hurts, is the lack of general community. You can get pretty good support via IRC, and the developers are extremely helpful - but it also doesn\'t have the following or thorough documentation that the "big boys" like Cake and Zend have, which is a shame. \n\n I\'m also very happy with Cake 2, as it\'s incorporated a ridiculous number of improvements for PHP 5.2.8+ (but it\'s still not entirely 5.3+ native). They have also revamped the insane conventions so that they actually make logical and consistent sense now (before 2.0, the conventions were completely inconsistent from model to view to controller). Cake is also better documented than Lithium and (I feel) even Zend. \n\n All that said, Zend  is  pretty much the status quo. I no longer use it due to the simple fact that it is painfully slow and underperformant. But that\'s what happens when you have a massive framework created specifically to shore up weaknesses in earlier versions of PHP. I\'m keeping a close eye on Zend 2 (which is currently in beta), as the main focus appears to be a hard push to take full advantage of PHP 5.3 (which, FYI, allows lambdas, magic methods, and all manner of other awesomeness). \n\n So my biased opinion is: as of right now, Lithium kills everything else. Not by a little, but by a lot.  \n\n Cake 2 comes in a very distant second (not fully PHP 5.3 optimized). I wouldn\'t even think of touching Zend 1.xx, but once Zend 2 is officially available and production ready, it should absolutely be worth a good, serious look (unfortunately, that could be MONTHS away). \n'

10692697	b' You may be able to use  keySource  or  keyDestination  to address your particular problem. \n\n Example \n\n In the following example, suppose we are getting data from an old-school relational database, where there is a one-to-many relationship between  Monster  and  Loot_Item .  This relationship is expressed by a  Monster_Id  foreign key in the  Loot_Item  table.  Let us also suppose that our REST service doesn\'t do any fancy-pants data nesting for us, since that seems to match the situation in your question fairly closely. \n\n keySource \n\n Now, let\'s set set "keySource" to my foreign key ("Monster_Id") and "key" to the name of the attribute where I want the actual data to go (say, "Monster").  If you break in the debugger, you will see in the attributes object that there is, in fact, a field called "Monster", and that it does point to the monster model data.  Hey, cool! \n\n includeInJSON \n\n However, if you toJSON that puppy, guess what?  It has put all the monster data in Monster_Id, just like you didn\'t want!  GAH!  We can fix that by setting "includeInJSON" to "Monster_Id".  Now, when it is converted to JSON, it puts the proper ID back into the Monster_Id field, when it is serializing your data to JSON, to send up to the server. \n\n Problem solved?  Er, well, actually, not  necessarily ... \n\n  CAVEAT :  This all sounds super-useful, but there\'s one fairly glaring problem that I have found with this scenario.  If you are using a templating engine (such as the one in Underscore.js) that requires you to convert your model to JSON, before passing it into the template, whoops -- you don\'t have access to your relational data. Alas, the JSON that we want for our messages is not necessarily the same JSON that we want to feed into our templates. \n'

12065319	b" so what actually happens when compiling an APK via the method described in the book is a little bit different than what you have described. What  actually happens  is that upon installation of the APK file it will  check to see if the user has  Python  installed,  not SL4A . If the user does not have Python installed it will prompt for a download , similar to how certain applications prompt to install BusyBox in order to use certain commands. This means that  the user doesn't need to have a scripting environment, or in fact even know what python is.  \n\n As for compiling 3rd party modules/libs into your APK, what happens is when you are compiling in Eclipse it will point to the folder on the computer containing python, and compile from there.  That means that all you need to do in order to get extra modules or libraries into the APK are to make sure that they are included in the folder that Eclipse looks to when compiling the APK.  By default I think that is your native Python folder, but I'm not 100% sure so somebody please correct me if I am wrong. \n\n Hope this helps! \n"

12618361	b' Personally, I\'d recommend PhoneGap because (at the time of this writing) PhoneGap has a website dedicated to it\'s development while Rhodes does not, and support for PhoneGap (Documentation, community, etc) is more readily available. Both frameworks can do just about the same thing by providing your phone\'s Web View with HTML tied to native features with JavaScript APIs. In terms of performance, they are identical because the only indicators of performance are the capabilities of your phone\'s web view. Plus, PhoneGap\'s branding is stylish and modern. \n\n Comparing with Adam Blum\'s answer point by point: \n\n \n No one is stopping you from implementing a Model View Controller arrangement of your code in PhoneGap. \n No one is preventing you from using an Object Relation Mapper (or similar) with PhoneGap. Try googling for "backbonejs" or "angularjs". \n PhoneGap has an app generator called "Build" to publish apps to all platforms easily, which is free for open source apps and up to one proprietary app, $9.99/mo for up to 25 commercial apps.     \n PhoneGap supports a large number of devices, including Windows Mobile.     \n PhoneGap has a plugin for Near Field Communication (NFC) that works on Android. iPhone 5 doesn\'t even have NFC.     This will get you started with barcode scanning in PhoneGap:  Phonegap Barcode Scanner  \n No IDE for PhoneGap. You\'ll have to use PhoneGap Build or use platform-dependent IDEs to test apps. \n \n'
