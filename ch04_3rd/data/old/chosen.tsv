I am also checked the timeout for ajax request it is set for 30 minutes. '
8799242	b"You're doing it wrong: you don't want to force a user to be stuck on a page for more than a few seconds at most in order to get service from your app. Instead, use a widget that will periodically query a status page (with ajax, of course) and display a message when the job is done.(What kind of excel file is taking 7 minutes to generate? A db dump?)Edit:Different browsers will behave differently with long ajax requests, so don't depend on them waiting around forever even if the user is willing to. Your app will be much more robust if you decouple requesting a report generation and downloading the report.This should give you an idea of what I'm talking about:create_my_excel_file.php:check_status.php:user_interface.php:"
8799484	b"Even if you manage to solve the timeout, making your clients wait 7 to 8 minutes without any progress feedback will be far from ideal. Better way would be to initiate the export on the server and return immediately. Once this returns you can give a progress message that says 'Export in progress..' or something. Then you can have an AJAX call that periodically checks the status of the export and returns the appropriate status message. Once exporting is done, you can change the progress feedback to 'Export complete: Download file' with Download file being a link to the excel file created on the server. you can also trigger a click on that link via code to automatically start the download.i.e.Assuming you have a DIV with class status which shows the export statusFirst AJAX call to initiate the export:Second AJAX call to poll export progress"

9087754	b'I\'m wondering if anyone knows a good way to remove duplicate Values in a LinkedHashMap? I have a LinkedHashMap with pairs of String and List&lt;String&gt;. I\'d like to remove duplicates across the ArrayList\'s. This is to improve some downstream processing.The only thing I can think of is keeping a log of the processed Values as I iterate over HashMap and then through the ArrayList and check to see if I\'ve encountered a Value previously. This approach seems like it would degrade in performance as the list grows. Is there a way to pre-process the HashMap to remove duplicates from the ArrayList values?To illustrate...if I haveString1>List1 (a, b, c)String2>List2 (c, d, e)I would want to remove "c" so there are no duplicates across the Lists within the HashMap.'
9087840	b"I'm assuming you need unique elements (contained in your Lists) and not unique Lists.If you need no association between the Map's key and elements in its associated List, just add all of the elements individually to a Set. If you add all of the Lists to a Set, it will contain the unique List objects, not unique elements of the Lists, so you have to add the elements individually.(you can, of course, use addAll to make this easier)"

9087985	b'I have created objects that are interfaces to a web service. One typical object would be a "TaskService". When a client uses one of these objects, it invokes one of the service\'s methods (such as "GetTasks") and the service will asynchronously go off to call the remote web service, and post back the retrieved data via a delegate.Currently, to use one of these services you have to create it with [[TaskService alloc] init], but I decided it makes more sense to make each service into a singleton object.Is it common to see singleton objects that hold reference to delegates? My main issue with the design, is that each object, whenever it requires use of a particular service, will have to set itself as the delegate before invoking the service, which doesn\'t seem quite right to me... What if another object were to set itself as the delegate inbetween you setting yourself as the delegate and invoking the service?Many thanks in advance!Regards,Nick'
9087998	b"If you read the openjdk source code (it's open source) you'd find that HashMap does not create threads. What makes you think it does?"
9088011	b"How did you verify that the HashMap code is actually using multiple Java threads? From your description, it sounds like you are looking at the OS level (e.g. Task Manager for Windows). This can be deceptive. The JVM can use multiple threads, for things like garbage collection, etc. But that doesn't mean that the Java code you are running is using multiple threads.The easiest way to find out for sure is to look at the OpenJDK source :-)."
9088048	b'Given your clarification, you want something like this:Using a set will remove the duplicate values, and the KeyValue lets us preserve the original hash key while doing so. Add getters and setters or generics as needed. This will also modify the original map and the lists in it in place. I also think the performance for this should be O(n).'
9088055	b'One of possible solution will be to add the following formula in column C: =N(EXACT(A1,B1)),copy it throughout the column down to the last row and then sum up the column C values using =SUM(C1:C5).'
9088198	b"When the occasion warrants the use of a Singleton object, I always avoid delegation for the reason you cite. Consumers of a singleton can't know (without some ugly coding) if they're stepping on some other consumer's toes by setting themselves as the one-and-only delegate of the singleton. NSNotifications are a much cleaner tool for the job; any arbitrary number of listeners can consume the notifications without caring who else may be listening.Delegation works best when there is clear ownership between the classes. Nobody owns a singleton."

9088296	b"Singleton isn't really the problem, you cause the same sort of issues by simply instancing a class and passing it about as a global variable.As other's have mentioned a queue is a possibility, or when you invoke a task on a service in your Singleton have it instance a TaskRequest object passing in the method and the call back delegate, that way requests can't trample on each other. In fact it would be a good idea to do that with a queue anyway."

I want to split the whole thing into words by removing any symbols/characters that are not relevant. For example remove commas, spaces, new lines, full stops, exclamation marks and anything that might be irrelevant so as to end up with only words.Is there an easy way of doing this in one go, for example by using a regular expression and the preg_split function or do I have to use the explode function a number of times: eg first get all the sentences (by removing '.', '!' etc). Then get words by removing ',' and spaces etc etc.I would not like to use the explode function on all the possible characters that are irrelevant since it is time consuming and I may accidentally omit some of all those possible characters.I would like to find a more automatic way.

What you can do is:Instead of doing something on touchstart do it on touchend. This is more natural anyway, since something should happen after you lift the fingerAfter touchstart see if there is any movement using touchmove. If none and touchend is called, do what you wanted to do for a tap. If there was movement, do whatever you wanted to do for sliding.I hope this helps."

9088661	b' Am I doing something totally weird with C# attributes?Yes.You are trying to use an attribute to express a business domain fact about the parameter. That\'s not what attributes are for. Attributes are for expressing facts about the programming language mechanism. That is, when you say:That is saying that the class itself is obsolete and that you should no longer use it because the class has been replaced with a different class. Do not use the obsolete attribute to state that the physical world thing that the class represents can no longer be manufactured and sold at a profit.That a particular parameter represents a row identifier is a fact about the business of your method, not about the mechanism of the method. You should put attributes on method parameters that express things like "this parameter has a default value" or "this parameter should be marshalled by value when called via COM interop" or "this parameter is going to be written to before it is read from" -- those are facts about the parameter as a variable in a programming language, rather than facts about how the parameter models some concept in your business process.For more thoughts on how to use attributes to express facts about mechanisms instead of business domains, see my article on the subject and the comments to it:'

9089241	b'I have a Java applet that uses the HTTPURLConnection class to upload very large files to an IIS-7 web-server. The applet chunks the files into pieces, then POSTs the pieces using fixed-length streaming to a PHP script.Occasionally, when uploading file chunks, the network connection between the client and the server mysteriously drops. When this happens, my call to the writeBytes() method throws an IOException which I catch. After catching this exception, I drop down into my finally block where I try to clean things up. Because insufficient data was written to the connection (remember, this is fixed-length streaming), the attempt to close the output stream also fails. As a result, the connection seemingly "sticks around" (i.e. the underlying socket remains open). This seems to be verified by looking at the source code to the close() method for the StreamingOutputStream class (note the comment stating that the socket cannot be closed).Question:Is there a graceful way I can shut down after catching an IOException while writing out to an HTTPURLConnection? Telling the HTTPURLConnection object to disconnect() doesn\'t seem to be good enough.Additional info:Here\'s the first exception I see when the network gets hosed, thrown by my call to the writeBytes() method of the HTTPURLConnection class:I catch this exception, and then attempt to close the DataOutputStream object that I was using to write to the connection. When I do so, I get this exception:I can verify that the socket is staying open, by noting that it takes 10 minutes for the failure entry to show up in the IIS log. That delay (10 minutes) happens to be my connection timeout value. Example lines from the IIS log (trimmed for brevity):Note that in the first two lines of the log we\'re transferring along nicely: 25 MB is sent each time, and a 200 status code is returned. The failure then shows up 10 minutes after the last successful transfer, with an unhelpful error 500 (and note that this was only a partial transfer; only ~15MB transferred). In actuality, this mysterious disconnect occurs about 1 minute into the whole procedure, so the timeout messages I\'m seeing in my IIS trace logs are red herrings. I see nothing helpful in my PHP logs, the HTTPERR log, or in the system log on the server.'

9089261	b'You can\'t use .on() and .off() that way. Your .on() code is a delegated handler:It\'s an event handler attached to the body object and looking for hover events from any element with class of "button-container".You cannot then just do .off() on one particular element like you are trying to do with this:That doesn\'t match the .on() signature so there\'s no matching event handler to remove. With delegated event handler (like you\'re using here with .on()), it\'s either all of nothing. You either remove the entire event handler or not. You can\'t tell it to just stop delegating on behalf of only some objects.If your objects are not dynamic and thus you don\'t need delegated event handling, you can do this to remove the specific event handler you want to remove:Working jsFiddle here: .Another approach that might be simpler is to just remove the class from the object like this:And a working jsFiddle here: .This leaves the event handler in place, but just removes the triggering class from the button-container so it won\'t match the event handler any more.

9218104	b'When testing my app using Instruments -> Activity Monitor, I\'m seeing a difference in memory use when a transition is done via the back button and follows the navigation controller vs calling a method in AppDelegate that uses pushViewController. If the navigation is completed by the navigation back button, then the memory use drops (I\'m new to iOS programming, but I believe the term is that it\'s releasing the subviews of that particular controller). If I navigate away from that view controller by using a method in AppDelegate that uses pushViewController , then the memory isn\'t released and if you go back to that view controller, it starts adding up again. I\'m working in XCode 4.2 writing for iOS5. This is the method in AppDelegate:The app flows like this: Main Page with 4 buttons. Button 1 pushes a UIViewController with a scrollview which has a subview (A). That subview also has a subview (B) with a close button. Hit the close button and subview(B) is removed from superview. Hit the back button on the top left and it returns to the Main Page. If you have no user interaction after a set period of time, the method above fires and send you to screenSaverViewController. Touch anywhere in the screen saver and you go back to Main Page. When watching the Activity Monitor, the amount of memory being reported as used in the Real Memory Usage window increases every time a subview(B) appears, but doesn\'t go down until you hit the back button and return to Main Page. If the screen saver kicks in, then it doesn\'t go down at all.Using either method, viewWillDisappear and viewDidDisappear both fire in the scrollview Controller. Why does one release memory and the other doesn\'t?All of my navigations work, it\'s just a memory usage issue that I need assistance with.Follow Up:picciano pointed out what I wasn\'t seeing - pushViewController does what it does. Pushes views on top of existing views. Can anyone suggest the proper replacement for pushViewController? The method has to fire from AppDelegate so that the app navigates from any view to the screen saver when the notification fires.Solved:What I ended up doing was moving the navigation from AppDelegate to the individual view controllers. I made sure to #import "Timer.h" and added my notification listener to viewDidLoad [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(applicationDidTimeout:) name:kApplicationDidTimeoutNotification object:nil]; and then added the applicationDidTimeout: method:1, in this case, is my screen saver controller. 0 = the root view. These numbers follow the navigation stack. root view (0) -&gt; screen saver (1) -&gt; main page (2) -&gt; 1 of 4 other pages'

9225895	b'The problem is that RavenDB server has no notion of the type of Value. When sending your object to the server, Value is persisted as a string, and when you later query that document, the deserializer does not know about the original type, so Value is deserialized as a string.You can solve this by adding the original type information to ObjectValuedAttribute:public class ObjectValuedAttribute { private object _value; public string Key { get; set; } public object Value { get { // convert the value back to the original type if (ValueType != null &amp;&amp; _value.GetType() != ValueType) { _value = TypeDescriptor .GetConverter(ValueType).ConvertFrom(_value); } return _value; } set {  _value = value; ValueType = value.GetType(); } } public Type ValueType { get; private set; }}In the setter of Value we also store the type of it. Later, when getting back the value, we convert it back to its original type.Following test passes:public class CodeChef : LocalClientTest { public class ObjectValuedAttribute { private object _value; public string Key { get; set; } public object Value { get { // convert value back to the original type if (ValueType != null &amp;&amp; _value.GetType() != ValueType) { _value = TypeDescriptor .GetConverter(ValueType).ConvertFrom(_value); } return _value; } set {  _value = value; ValueType = value.GetType(); } } public Type ValueType { get; private set; } } [Fact] public void Store_WithDateTime_IsPersistedCorrectly() { AssertValueIsPersisted(DateTime.Now); } private void AssertValueIsPersisted&lt;T&gt;(T value) { using (var store = NewDocumentStore()) { var expected = new ObjectValuedAttribute { Value = value }; using (var session = store.OpenSession()) { session.Store(expected); session.SaveChanges(); } using (var session = store.OpenSession()) { var actual = session .Query&lt;ObjectValuedAttribute&gt;() .Customize(x =&gt; x.WaitForNonStaleResults()) .Single(); Assert.Equal(expected.Value, actual.Value); } } }}'

In Windows 7, using these methods, you will encounter junction points and/or hard links when searching beneath the C:\\Users... tree because of the junction points added in for backwards compatibility with XP generation apps. MS fires an UnauthorizedAccessException when you try and read one of these junctions (to prevent possible infinite loops in the arrangement of those junctions), and it causes the entire GetFiles() or GetDirectories() call to fail, returning nothing. As a solution, I implemented a variant of , which will iterate files one at a time, allowing you to handle the exception when you hit a junction and continue on.

To summarise, every time control enters a new execution context, the following happens (a lot more than this happens, but this is part of it): For each VariableDeclaration and VariableDeclarationNoIn d in code, in source text order do   Let dn be the Identifier in d.  Let varAlreadyDeclared be the result of calling env\xe2\x80\x99s HasBinding concrete method passing dn as the argument. If varAlreadyDeclared is false, then  Call env\xe2\x80\x99s CreateMutableBinding concrete method passing dn and configurableBindings as the arguments. Call env\xe2\x80\x99s SetMutableBinding concrete method passing dn, undefined, and strict as the arguments.

12583640	b"You might employ case statement to get counts of exclusive ranges:This produces the same result as yours (inclusive ranges):count_all is set to 1 to mark open-ending range.Sql Fiddle is here.UPDATE: an attempt at explanation.The first part starting with with and ending with closing bracket is called CTE. Sometimes it is referred to as inline view because it can be used multiple times in the same query and under some circumstances is updateable. Here it is used to prepare data for ranges and is appropriately named ranges. This name one uses in main query. Val is maximum value of a range, count_all is 1 if range has no upper end (18+, more, or however you wish to call it). Data rows are combined by means of union all. You might copy/paste section between parenthesis only and run it just to see the results.Main body joins experiences table with ranges using cross join. This creates combinations of all rows from experiences and ranges. For row d 11 there will be 4 rows,First case statement in select list produces caption by checking count_all - if it is one, outputs more, else constructs caption using upper range value. Second case statement counts using sum(1). As aggregate functions ignore nulls, and case having no else evaluates to null if match was not found, it is sufficient to check if count_all is true (meaning that this row from experiences is counted in this range) or if vendor experience is less or equal to upper range value of current range. In example above 11 will not be counted for first range but will be counted for all the rest.Results are then grouped by val and count_all. To better see how it works you might remove group by and sum() and look at numbers before aggregation. Order by empname, val will help to see how values of [count] change depending on different val per an employee.Note: I did my best with my current level of english language. Please don't hesitate to ask for clarification if you need one (or two, or as many as you need). "

All you have to do now is route all servlets through 8080 and your specific thread through 8081 (using completely independent thread pool).If you don't want someone to abuse this, add a servlet filter to check whether correct port is used based on requested URI.However reading your rationale: I have a specific synchronous service that locks up a lot of the serving threadsYou'll better start and manage your own pool of threads (check out ExecutorService) and use asynchronous servlet.

12584423	b"We're trying to come up with a way for an R function to handle a model which has multiple responses, multiple explanatory variables, and possibly shared parameters between the responses. For example:specifies two responses and four explanatory variables. X3 appears in both, and we want the user to control whether the associated parameter value is the same or different. ie:which is a model with four 'b' parameters, ora model with five parameters.Two possibilities:Specify all the explanatory variables in one formula and supply a matrix mapping responses to explanatories. In which caseFoo( Y1+Y2 ~ X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 + X5, map=cbind(c(1,1,1,0),c(0,0,1,1)))would correspond to the first case, and would be the second. Obviously some parsing of the LHS would be needed, or it could be cbind(Y1,Y2). The advantage of this notation is that there is also other information that might be required for each parameter - starting values, priors etc - and the ordering is given by the ordering in the formula.Have multiple formulae and a grouping function that just adds an attribute so shared parameters can be identified - the two examples then become:Foo( Y1 ~ X1+X2+G(X3,1), Y2 ~ G(X3,1)+X4)where the X3 parameter is shared between the formula, andFoo( Y1 ~ X1+X2+X3, Y2 ~ X3+X4)which has independent parameters. The second parameter of G() is a grouping ID which gives the power to share model parameters flexibly.A further explanation of the G function is shown by the following:would be a model where:where there are two independent parameters for X3 (G(X3,1) and G(X3,3)). How to handle a group that refers to a different explanatory variable is an open question - suppose that model had Y4~G(X3,2) - that seems to imply a shared parameter between different explanatory variables, since there's a G(X4,2) in there.This notation seems easier for the user to comprehend, but if you also have to specify starting values then the mapping between a vector of starting values and the parameters they correspond to is no longer obvious. I suspect that internally we'd have to compute the mapping matrix from the G() notation.There may be better ways of doing this, so my question is... does anyone know one?"

12584657	b"Yes. The answer is yes. This controls browser and some ISP caching. It will cache dynamic content for the time you specify in many locations. Not all. Not all browsers will follow the rules, not all ISPs will follow the rules. Famously, AOL used to disregard people's cache rules and cache everything for strange times leading to broken pages on the early web.On a dynamic page that isn't cached, you can use this value to set pages that change relatively in-frequently to cache for 10 minutes to an hour. For images, css, js files and things for longer. Caching for 8 hours is probably too much, as it is much longer than 1 hour, but only reduces the total number of hits for the content by 7.Other CachingThere are other, probably more reliable, ways to cache content. You can look into query caching, file caching, memcached. All of these options can also be used to cache things other than content as well. They will all help you speed up repetitive actions.Query CachingMany databases, MySQL being the defacto standard, offer query caching. This will cache the results of queries on tables that haven't been updated since the last time the query was run. Perfect for normalized look-up tables. Ideal for tables that are updated only once in a blue moon. Works well for tables that are updated about once and hour to even every 10 minutes. For tables that change more often than that, they will produce limited time-saving results.File Caching and MemcachedThese can be used to cache key/value pairs of information. They can be page_url/page_content or page_list/array_of_pages_in_site or any other key/value pairs you need. This is how most people go about caching pages for 10-60 minutes these days. They are reliable, controlled on the server, and can be flushed instantly if needed. They don't need to be time based, if your logic is written correctly you can treat these like the query cache. Only when information is updated do you flush that key from the cache, and then the page updates instantly and otherwise sits in cache.Header CacheWhich brings us back to header cache. It is still smart to cache here for about 10 minutes even with the other caches in place. The other caches still require requests of the server, which can slow it down. While this won't reduce that pressure by much, it will reduce it. And it doesn't take much effort to install."

I was wondering if I should apply the concept to something I wrote recently.We previously had two classes that were almost identical, aside from a couple small differences. They contained some basic database access features, but operated on different (but related) object types. So we previously had class that were structured something like this:I took the majority of near-duplicated methods and refactored them out into a BaseToolDBHandler() class, and inherited it from the other two, providing a few abstract methods and properties to handle differences in accessing the database parameters themselves. Would it make sense to make the BaseToolDBHandler a helper class instead, contained within the database accessors, and provide them a common interface the previously abstract properties/methods? Or should I leave it as a case of inheritance?'

12585373	b"Avoid subqueriesAs I understand your inner selects, they serve two purposes: find any name of an associated image, and count the number of associated images. You probably might achieve both using a left join instead of an inner select:I haven't tried this, but perhaps the MySQL engine is smart enough to only perform that part of the query for the rows you're actually returning.Note that there are no guarantees at all about which image name this query will return for a given set of images. If you want reproducible results, you should use some aggregating function there, e.g. MIN(advert_images.image_name) to select the lexicographically first image.Separate select but no loopIf the above does not work, i.e. the query will still examine the advert_images table for all rows of the computed result, then you're probably really better off by performing a second query. You might however try avoiding the for loop, and instead fetch all those rows in a single query:The ten parameters in this query correspond to the ten rows of the result you're currently generating. Note that an advert without an associated photo will not be included in that result at all. So make sure to default num_photos to zero and imagename to NULL in your code.Temporary tableAnother way to achieve what you're attempting to do would be to use an explicit temporary in-memory table: first you select the results you're interested in, and then you retrieve all the associated information.This will ensure that all the other tables are only queried for the results you're currently working on. After all, there is little magic about the advert_images table except the fact that you might want multiple rows from it.Subquery as join factorBuilding on the approach from the preceding paragraph, you can even avoid managing a temporary table, and use a subquery in its stead:Again you determine the relevant rows by using data from the adverts table only, and join only the required rows from other tables. Most likely, that intermediate result will internally be stored in a temporary table, but that is up to the SQL server to decide."

When the combo box value changes, I put documentid and action to sessionScope and perform a partial update of the panel. Everything works fine and the documents are shown the right way. When I press the button to create a new document (documentid="",action="newDocument") I get a new document and the edit boxes in the panel are empty, just the way it should be. However, if I pick an existing document from the combo box after creating a new one, the edit boxes are not updated but stay the same as in the document I just created. I figured out that the partial refresh worked for the datasource (documentid is correct) but it seems that the data binding didn\'t work, meaning that the values from the document are not written to the edit boxes. Afterwards, if I pick another document from the combo box or perform another partial refresh, the data binding suddenly works again.Does anyone have an idea how to solve this? Why do I need 2 partial refreshes here?What i tried to solve this problem but didn\'t work:Changing scope of datasource to requestPerforming full update instead of just a partial update of the panelSetting ignorerequestparameter to trueAll possible settings of computewithformI know I could manually write the data from the document to the edit boxes, but I think it should be possible to solve this without a workaround.'

12586048	b'Interesting question (I wish all package authors worried a lot more in advance about how they were going to create extensions to the basic Wilkinson-Rogers formula notation ...)How about something like or something like that for your second example above? The formula component gives the list of equations.The shared component simply lists which response variables share the same parameter for specified predictor variables. It could obviously be mapped into a logical or binary table, but (for me at least -- this is certainly in the eye of the beholder) it\'s more straightforward. I think the map solution above is awkward when (as in this case) a variable (such as X3) is shared in two distinct sets of relationships.I guess some straightforward rule like "starting values in the order in which the parameters appear in the list of formulas" -- in this case would be OK, but it might be nice to provide a helper function that would tell the users the names of the coefficient vector (i.e. the order) given a formula/shared specification ...From a bit of personal experience, I would say that embedding more fanciness in the formula itself leads to pain ... for example, the original nlme syntax with the random effects specified separately was easier to deal with than the new lme4-style syntax with random effects and fixed effects mixed in the same formula ...An alternative (which I don\'t like nearly as well) would bewhere new parameters are indicated by some sort of tag (with [1] being implicit).Also note suggestion from the chat room by @Andrie that interfaces designed for structural equation modeling (sem, lavaan packages) may be useful references.'

12586100	b"I believe the issue is you're adding a massive TableLayout in to a View. It has to go through measure and layout through every single one of the cells to fit it in to the layout.One thing you can do is create the single TableLayout in onPreExecute and add it to the layout as such. Then, you can create each panel and add it to the TableLayout as they are being made. This would do all the layout stuff on a single cell rather than all of them in one large clump.One thing that I'd like to point out that may-or-may not be related is you have one TableLayout created in a background thread. Inflating Views in a background thread has been known to cause problems on some devices. You're not inflating. You're creating a View object so it most likely is not the same, but I guess there's no gaurantee.

I solved the issue by switching to the POST method.&lt;/EDIT&gt;I have a class I'm using at work to batch reassign leads in a SugarCRM database.Everything works perfectly in the class except for this one function:This function allows the user to check off any number of leads from a generated list, and re-assign those leads to any number of reps in a list equally, and log those changes in a table for auditing purposes.The problem I am having is that this function will seize up and hang if the user selects anywhere from 20-25 leads or so. Any less than 20 and it never hangs. This is an issue because the user must be able to re-assign hundreds or potentially thousands of leads.Any idea as to why it would lock up (the number of leads that it locks up with varies, usually 20-25) like this? The change is immediate when it's under 20 leads.EDIT:Updated the code to show statement closes. Still no changes in behaviour. When the number of leads are selected that causes it to break, no changes are made. It does not do the first 19-20 and stop on the rest, no changes get made and nothing is added to the audit table. Less than the breaking point and all changes are done and logged in the audit table.I'm using PDO to connect to the db:And I get no errors there.

Templating that way is how most of the standard library algorithms work, like std::fill or std::copy; they are made to work with iterators so that you can fill a container that already has elements in it, or you can take an empty container and fill it up with data by using std::back_inserter.This is a very good design IMO, and takes advantage of the power of templates and the iterator concept.You can use it like this (but you already know this):I get the feeling that you are afraid of using templates, that they are not "normal" C++, or that they should be avoided and are bloated or something. I assure you, they are very normal and a powerful language feature that no other language (that I know of) has, so whenever it is appropriate to use them, USE THEM. And here, it is very appropriate.'

That is a bit of a hack, but it may suit your purposes. Even if it is a complex zip, you could always use str_replace to remove the - and check is_numeric.

Instead of using the normal onchange event, it executes every 300ms and only calls the handler if it detects a changed value. I'm using prototype's Form.Element.Observer, if this means anything to you.Now, in Firefox, when the user hovers over the option and the timed value check function fires, the handler is called because the browser says that the value has changed. What I would like to do is be able to detect when the option has actually been selected by the user instead of simply hovered over. I realize in the Prototype documentation, they explicitly note this bug (or feature, depending how you look at it) but I would like to be able to normalize the behavior.In a way, this is somewhat similar to a question I've seen on StackOverflow before ( Detect if an HTML select element is expanded (without manually tracking state) ) but I was hoping someone out there would be able to tell me how to do this for only a specific select element and when it's closed instead of expanded.To get a better idea of what I mean, check out  , mess with the select element and check out the console logs."

12586666	b' Updated Tip at bottom and new code for debuggingIt seems you havn\'t quite grasped jQuery yet and i\'m not sure what your JavaScript is supposed to do in the end as its obviously unfinished, but I took the liberty of rewriting your js in FULL jQuery syntax with some comments. I hope this might help you some. Additional InfoAlso, you html for your button can be changed using the jQuery/JavaScript I\'ve provided. Since my jQuery code has a function to handle form submission, the input button can therefor be a normal form submit buttonChange:To:Not that either method is incorrect, you could still use the button onclick if you want, but then you dont need my .submit code. Just something to keep in mind. TIPIt is MUCH easier to Debug using CONSOLE rather than ALERT. To see the console in different browsers is a different process in each. Below I\'ll tell you how to access the Console in the top 3 major browsers. IE7+ - Simply press the "F12" key one time - Then click on the "tab" that has the text "Console" (3rd from left)  FireFox - The easiest method is to install FireBug - Once installed, simply click on the little "bug" in the upper right of the browser - then make sure the "Console" tab is active by clicking on it  Google Chrome - Simply Press "Ctrl+Shift+J" - Just a tip, make sure your Chrome browser has Window Focus when you do this shortcut keypress - Also, click the "Console" tab and you can see all your consoled results thereUsing your browser\'s console is not only a great way to debug JavaScript but it will also tell you Errors in files loading, flag potential warning on things like cross-domain issues and much more!'

12586933	b'For fairness, you should include the data transfer times to get the data into and out of the GPU. It\'s not hard to write a blazing fast CUDA function. The real trick is in figuring out how to keep it fed, or how to hide the cost of data transfer by overlapping it with other necessary work. Unless your routine is 100% compute-bound, including data transfer in your units-of-work-done-per-unit-of-time is critical to understanding how your implementation would handle, say, a lot more units of work. For cross-device comparisons, it might be useful to report units of work performed per unit of time per processor core. The per processor core will help normalize large differences between, say, a 200 core and a 2000 core CUDA device. If you\'re talking about your algorithm (not just output), it is useful to describe how you broke the problem down for parallel execution - your block/thread distribution, for example.Make sure you are not measuring performance on a debug build, or running in a debugger. Debugging adds overhead.Make sure that your work sample is large enough that it is significantly above the "noise floor". A test run that takes a few seconds to complete will be measuring more of your function and less of the ambient noise of the environment than a test run that completes in milliseconds. You can always divide the units of work by the test execution time to arrive at a sexy "units per nanosecond" figure, but you don\'t actually measure it that way.'

Your provided code always "validates" to true, because validate() returns the validation object. The actual check to see whether the form is valid is what valid() is for.

One way is by returning false at the end of the callback.So your code should be something like:Here is a demo: Another way to do this would be to let the plugin do the validation itself and just tell it what to do if the form is valid, using the submitHandler option when you initialize the validation object.

Just an exercise. I chose BST as an example to implement some things I wanted to try out in the language)Header -CPP -and my test code is as follows - In the last step where I say bst.DeleteData(77); I have a problem. The node with '77' gets deleted alright and gets replaced by '78' in a fashion you delete a node with two children from a BST. However after deleting the node that had '78' before deletion of the parent node that had '77' still points to a non-null location. I am calling my private function DeleteDataPrivate(int data, TNode* &amp;root); which sets the TNode pointer to NULL after deleting it. Also I am passing the pointer-by-reference in the function so that the NULL value gets assigned to the deleted node pointer as the recursion stack unfolds back. This does not happen. Can someone explain what I am doing wrong here?Thank you.ChinmayUPDATEAs per Dan's comment below the issue was with values being passed to local variables which made copies of my pointers and were not assigned back to anything. I have modified my function to account for this by using a pointer-to-pointer to so that the value of TNode pointer returned by the unwinding recursion is stored at the correct location in memory and not in some copy of TNode pointer.The modified function is as followsOfcourse this can be structured better and stuff but my goal here was to learn simple but tricky things here and thanks to Dan and others I have done that here."

12588030	b"Ankur has the right idea but I find you can really simplify the concept down further.For me it comes down to What versus HowIf you know what you want to render but not how it's likely you'll use a partial to let it determine how to render the information.For example, maybe your view model is for an invoice. You're invoice view model probably already has all the information you need about the invoice itself, including an enumerable of the line items on the invoice perhaps. A partial might be a good choice for the line items so that it's self contained. You already have the line items details (the what), but a partial will handle how it gets rendered (the how)On the flip side, maybe your invoice view model has a customer ID on it but no actual customer details. Here you don't have the what, so you'd pass in the customer ID to an Action and it'll get what data it needs and pass it off to the view to render how it seems fit.So in summary if you already have all the data you want to work with, just stick with a Partial, but if you are missing information that you need to obtain, Action would be better.Where this get really fuzzy around the edges is when a Partial view includes the ability to retrieve it's own data via Ajax (or other technologies). In which case you might be able to get away with making that Customer details portion in my example, a Partial, and have it retrieve the data it needs Using Ajax after the client get's the response. But that's more up to you if that sort of thing even makes sense for your implementation."

MutableSet provides built-in definitions of all other set methods based on those methods. That way you get the full set interface cheaply. (And if you do this, addIterable is defined for you, under the name extend.) discard in the standard set interface appears to be what you have called delete here. So rename delete to discard. Also, instead of having a separate popRandom method, you could just define popRandom like so:That way you don't have to maintain two separate item removal methods. Finally, in your item removal method (delete now, discard according to the standard set interface), you don't need an if statement. Instead of testing whether index == len(self.list) - 1, simply swap the final item in the list with the item at the index of the list to be popped, and make the necessary change to the reverse-indexing dictionary. Then pop the last item from the list and remove it from the dictionary. This works whether index == len(self.list) - 1 or not:"

If you are referencing an assembly that isn't strongly named then that assembly can't be loaded into the GAC (and the .Net runtime won't check there anyway, see How the Runtime Locates Assemblies).If you are referencing a strongly named assembly (or in fact any assembly) and want to accept multiple different versions of that assembly (e.g. v1.0.0.0 and v1.0.1.0), or you want to release a newer version of your assembly and allow existing applications to continue functioning without needing to be recompiled then you can use Assembly Binding Redirection.If you want to be able to reference an assembly regardless of what key is used to sign that assembly then you are best off not signing that assembly at all (and therefore not adding it to the GAC).I believe that you can also subscribe to the assembly resolve event, however using assembly binding redirection is the preferred method, as long as it provides the desired behaviour."

12588511	b'There is no possible way to programmatically obtain the information you are seeking.If there is a "problem with the internet connection", such as is very common with cellular data connections that\'ve just entered a dead zone, you will see the cellular link remain established for several seconds until it times out. During this waiting period while the link layer still thinks it\'s connected but no packets can get through, the only thing you can do is start waiting yourself -- and pick an arbitrary timeout value less than or equal to the timeout value of the link layer.Since timeout-based connectivity is based on waiting an arbitrary period of time and then making a decision about whether you think the packets are going to arrive or not, there is no general solution to determine -- without blocking -- if the connection will succeed. After all, just because a packet sent immediately prior got through, doesn\'t mean that the connection couldn\'t be killed immediately after.I disagree with the test that tries to fetch a small resource from a URL somewhere. That test is problematic because it involves blocking, which will slow down your program. If the packet your program actually tries to send out is able to get through before the link layer or protocol layer times it out, you\'ll get results. If the packet doesn\'t make it through, you won\'t get results. It\'s that simple.Internet connectivity is a "transient" phenomenon: it is impossible to be sure that it is available ahead of time. It\'s there one instant and gone the next. Like the existence of a file on disk. Instead of trying to change the flow of your program\'s logic depending on internet connectivity, you should instead just react to situations where connectivity is demonstrably not available, such as the packet didn\'t get through, or you didn\'t get a response, or the network interface declares that it is down (which in essence is what the Android API you\'re calling is doing). Handle the exception; don\'t try to determine whether it\'s up and then do something.In conclusion, the very concept of an isNetworkConnected() function is mostly meaningless, except for the simple test of whether the link layer thinks it\'s connected or not (that much, at least, can save you time and effort, because no link layer obviously implies that the connection is known not to be available, whereas all other failure states involve unknowns until after the problem is detected experimentally.) The problem is that even the most reliable and strict tests for network availability within the implementation of isNetworkConnected() cannot atomically guarantee that, between the time the isNetworkConnected() function returns and the time that you start trying to upload/download real data, the result hasn\'t changed. It\'s basically a race condition that cannot possibly be solved, because you don\'t control the user\'s internet infrastructure, so you can\'t atomically "lock" it into a working state, perform your work, and release the lock. Can\'t be done.'

12588521	b'Yes, you can do anything (more or less) strictly with div tags (with exceptions, like forms and inputs, and images, and what not). But that\'s not the point.First, specific tags have default css applied to them. li\'s have bullets, for example. You can change these, but in many situations, it\'s just easier to use the tag that has the style you\'re looking for.But the most important reason is what\'s called "semantic markup", which is the concept that which element you use corresponds to a semantic meaning. li means it\'s a list of items, so even if you have no CSS applied (such as when a screen reader reads a page aloud for blind person) then it still has meaning.

12588659	b'The difference is pretty big, actually.Take the first one and add a line after the print:You\'ll see that Does this execute? isn\'t printed because the exception interrupts the flow of the code and stops it when it isn\'t caught.On the other hand:Will print both the stack trace and Does this execute?. That\'s because catching the exception is like saying, "We\'ll handle this here and continue executing."One other remark, the catch block is where error recovery should happen, so if an error occurs but we can recover from it, we put the recovery code there.Edit:Here\'s an example of some error recovery. Let\'s say we have a non-existent file at C:\\nonexistentfile.txt. We want to try and open it, and if we can\'t find it, show the user a message saying it\'s missing. This could be done by catching the FileNotFoundException produced here:So there\'s a few things to note here:We catch the FileNotFoundException and use a custom error message instead of printing the stack trace. Our error message is cleaner and more user-friendly than printing a stack trace. In GUI applications, the console may not even be visible to the user, so this may be code to show an error dialog to the user instead. Just because the file didn\'t exist doesn\'t mean we have to stop executing our code.We declare throws IOException in the method signature instead of catching it alongside the FileNotFoundException. In this particular case, the IOException will be thrown here if we fail to read the file even though it exists. For this method, we\'re saying that handling errors we encounter while reading the file isn\'t our responsibility. This is an example of how you can declare an irrecoverable error (by irrecoverable, I mean irrecoverable here, it may be recoverable somewhere further up, such as in the method that called printFileToConsole).I accidentally introduced the finally block here, so I\'ll explain what it does. It guarantees that if the Scanner was opened and an error occurs while we\'re reading the file, the Scanner will be closed. This is important for many reasons, most notably that if you don\'t close it, Java will still have the lock on the file, and so you can\'t open the file again without exiting the application.'

12588678	b'I\'ve seen lots of different approaches to this problem, from simple to way over-engineered. Sadly, I think I\'ve been the designer of a couple of the way over-engineered approaches. Fortunately, I\'ve learned some lessons. Here\'s what I think is the lowest-tech approach:What you want to do first is to make a design-only copy of the database. I\'ll call it productiondocs.ntf. I\'ll refer to the original as alldocs.nsf. Add two agents to productiondocs.ntf, and make sure that they are protected against design refresh/replace. Call the first agent "synch", and set it to run on new or modified documents, and write code in to simply copy the new/modified docs into alldocs.nsf. Make sure to check isValid to protect against processing deleted documents in this agent\'s main loop. Call the second agent "purge". Write code to check the date (created, mod, or a data field in the document, depending on the rule you want to enforce) and delete docs that are more than one year old. Now, you can use selective replication -- but just once. Make a selective replica of alldocs.nsf, containing only one year\'s worth of docs, and call it yeardocs.nsf. Then make a non-replica copy of yeardocs.nsf and call it production.nsf. Finally, replace the design of production.nsf using production.ntf. Double-check that the agents are there and that they are protected against design refresh/replace operations. (Some versions of designer screwed this up!) Schedule synch to run as often as you need, and schedule purge to run daily or weekly. Replicate production.nsf to all servers, and move your users over to production.nsf.(Note: you could do it in reverse, keeping your users in the existing database after purging it; but honestly I think you\'ll get an extra performance boost by starting with a clean new NSF so that\'s why I wrote it up the way I did.)'

Basically, players either invite each other through facebook, email, etc and then start playing. We debate what is the best strategy for facilitating the real time communication between players (sending events, etc). Coming from web development, we used comet and long polling which worked great. However, it's not clear what's the best way to achieve that on iOS.Seems like APN (Apple Push Notifications) is not suitable in our case for two reasons: the delay can be pretty significant, up to few seconds, as far as we understand. Also, using APN requires the user to authorize notifications. If the user doesn't authorize this then it won't be possible to play the game. Also, we understand Apple's Game Kit (Game Center) can be of value in our case however it's not clear how it interacts with invites through facebook etc. Also, not clear if we need to get into bed with Apple's Game Center and how it'll affect the user experience.

12588833	b"I recommend using a BufferedOutputStream wrapping a FileOutputStream. I do not believe you will see any performance improvement by mucking with ByteBuffer and FileChannel, and that you'll be left with a lot of hard-to-maintain code if you go that route.The reasoning is quite simple: regardless of the approach you take, the steps involved are the same:Generate bytes. You don't say how you plan to do this, and it could introduce an additional level of temporary buffering into the equation. But regardless, the Java data has to be turned into bytes.Accumulate bytes into a buffer. You want to buffer your data before writing it, so that you're not making lots of small writes. That's a given. But where that buffer lives is immaterial.Move bytes from Java heap to C heap, across JNI barrier. Writing a file is a native operation, and it doesn't read directly from the Java heap. So whether you buffer on the Java heap and then move the buffered bytes, or buffer in a direct ByteBuffer (and yes, you want a direct buffer), you're still moving the bytes. You will make more JNI calls with the ByteBuffer, but that's a marginal cost.Invoke fwrite, a kernel call that copies bytes from the C heap into a kernel-maintained disk buffer.Write the kernel buffer to disk. This will outweigh all the other steps combined, because disks are slow.There may be a few microseconds gained or lost depending on exactly how you implement these steps, but you can't change the basic steps.The FileChannel does give you the option to call force(), to ensure that step #5 actually happens. This is likely to actually decrease your overall performance, as the underlying fsync call will not return until the bytes are written. And if you really want to do it, you can always get the channel from the underlying stream.Bottom line: I'm willing to bet that you're actually IO-bound, and there's no cure for that save better hardware."

If the first buffer has a Content-size, so much the better - you can pick a buffer, (or vector of buffers to speed up rendering to improve user-experience) of the appropriate size. If you're clever about it, you can start rendering the first buffer before the second one is completely full, and so on.Depending on loading, you can adjust the bin contents dynamically to adjust to the current demand.

And even static SQL in a row-level trigger cannot in general query the table that the trigger is defined on without generating a mutating table exception.Rather than calling dynamic SQL from your trigger, however, you can potentially write some dynamic SQL that generates the trigger in the first place using the same data dictionary tables. The triggers themselves would statically refer to :new.column_name and :old.column_name. Of course, you would have to either edit the trigger or re-run the procedure that dynamically creates the trigger when a new column gets added.

12589410	b'From this discussion on the Clojure discussion group it seems you have encountered a design decision made by Rich Hickey. Specifically, because BigDecimal does not have a constructor of the signature BigDecimal(Long long) (Edit: and therefore leaves the compiler having to choose between the int and long constructors - see comments below for discussion on why using Integer works), the compiler will not attempt to "guess" which constructor you will meant, and explicitly fails.  The bottom line is specific type requirements on the Java side require explicit boxing on order to have correct and non-brittle code. - Rick HickeyNote that literals are parsed as primitives, not "boxed" types, per this documentation: In contrast to previous versions of Clojure, numeric literals are parsed as primitive longs or doubles. To understand why the other operations work, you have to dig into Clojure source, specifically Compiler.java and its inner class NumberExpr. That is the where your literal gets auto-boxed to a Long and the compiler has no problem in turn calling Object.getClass() (which both type and class do). In the Compiler.getMatchingParams(), the Clojure compiler attempts to resolve which constructor of BigDecimal to use. However, you have explicitly specified that your parameter has the type Long - there is no constructor for BigDecimal that takes that type. Maybe this isn\'t "common sense," but Rich Hickey made the decision that you need to be precise about the type of your parameters and that they have to match the type of the Java class. The compiler is refusing to guess your intent.Note the following:Also note that this Java code is valid and resolves to the int constructor for BigDecimal:But this code also fails (even though it "should" use the int constructor):tl;dr: Clojure supports Java interop but that does not mean it has to follow the promotion rules of Java Language Specification.What about cast?A comment below asks about (cast). In that case you are explicitly telling the Clojure compiler to delegate type resolution to the JVM. Note the following (nonsensical) code that compiles, yet fails at runtime:Epilogue IIThere has been quite a bit of discussion on this topic in the Clojure community. Please check out these detailed threads:Enhanced Primitive Support (Rich Hickey)Clojure 1.3 treatment of integers and longs (Nathan Marz)'

12589703	b'It sounds like your computation will always be slower than real-time rendering, so the design that most makes sense to me is a separation of a "real-time" working rendering and a "production" rendering. For example, you can have a thread that does the heavy calculations and stores the result in memory or in a file for quick lookup. You can have this thread replacing less accurate models while you\'re rendering them in a separate thread.The name of the game with any sort of real-time interaction - that is, any interactive moving through your model - is to move as much computation out of the rendering thread as possible. You want your rendering to be only looking up data from a model and have that model updated in parallel. The reason that all the tutorials focus on the rendering speed is that they\'re ignoring (for the sake of scope) how the model is generated - they just use the teapot or a model from a file for brevity\'s sake, and focus on rendering performance only. For any task that requires computation or a changing model - a 3D game where objects are moving and have physics, for example - it\'s standard to compute everything out of the rendering loop so that the rendering can be as smooth as possible, even if you\'re rendering a stale model.If you don\'t want to mess with threading, you can do a poor-man\'s version by including a "loading" or "compiling" step where you usually skip rebuilding your model, but on a keypress or menu action, you rebuild the entire model while making the user wait. After the model is built, they are free to navigate around, skipping the computation until another gesture re-loads or re-compiles the model. This is a good intermediate step, because it can lead incrementally to dealing with threads later if you decide the long pause is not acceptable by your requirements.'

(A non-network debian stable repository is available, which allows for virtualenv and company)Some of the packages/dependencies have C extensions which are essential to the performance of the application.It is desired that the C extentions be compiled in advance to avoid installation of GCC and company.Within these constraints, what is the fastest, the easiest or even (preferably) the 'right' way to package (and then install) the python module dependencies? Do I just grab the source for each package and bdist it myself?"

On the home page I have a list of every users microposts seperated into two lists. One has only sale microposts and the other only purchase microposts. I am trying to put a search bar on top of each of these lists that can search through only those. Then when the user searches, the column displays the search results. The problem is that all of the tutorials I find such as  go through how to search through an object with its own controller (such as if I wanted to search through microposts). How can I only search through microposts that are purchase. or only search through those that are sale?Edit: ClarificationHere is what I am supposed to add in the app/views/home.html.erbbut what I would like is two of these, one that searches through all microposts that have the kind (kind is a column in the micropost table) purchase and one that searches through all microposts that have the kind sale. I don\'t know the correct syntax for this. Also, here is the relevant part of my microposts_controller.rbEdit 2:you all have good suggestions for defining the @microposts, @purchases, and @sales.

How can I differentiate these two search forms, and search definitions so that one searches through all the microposts with the kind sale and one through all the microposts with the kind purchase. I want the searches to be completely different. Can I id the search forms somehow? How can I define the sale search and purchase search differently in the model. I know I am supposed to have something like in micropost.rb. Do I need one definition for purchases and one for sales?Edit again:I have tried to make this question more clear at RoR: how can I search only microposts with a certain attribute?'

ALSO before doing merges and rebases I have learned that is good to do a checkout -b new_new_branch_name from your new_branch to do the rebasing and merging in. That way if it gets screwed up you can just delete that branch and start again with no ill effect.git rebase -i HEAD~10 means interactively rebase the past 10 commits. This means make changes to the historical commits that were made (the current state itself doesn\'t change).This brings up an editor that allows you to squash, reorder or delete commits in your commit history. This can be an extremely useful command for tidying up lots of different changes in different commits to be grouped in fewer commits. We always try to squash (if needed) before code review.Caveats: Interactive rebase is best used for branches not yet pushed to remotes, especially if there are other collaborators (you can mess their history up if not careful). Basically it\'s best to use when you\'re either still local, or you have pushed to remote but you know that no-one else has worked on that branch.git checkout path_to/and_file_at/myfile.rbThis was revert a single file to whatever state it was in at the last commit. Basically it throws away your local (uncommitted) changes.git clean - Recursively removes files that aren\'t under version control, starting from the current directory.'

12590313	b'So you\'ve asked many different questions here. I\'ll go through them one-by-one. Where should the PHP go, embed in the html file, in a seperate php file which the form action = "" submits to, or in an include file?PHP is never embedded directly in an HTML document. Rather, think of PHP as a dynamic HTML generator. It creates HTML (or JSON, or whatever) that is sent the browser, but is never actually sent to the browser itself. That\'s why it\'s referred to as a server-side language, as opposed to something like JavaScript (which can also be server-side, but that\'s not relevant). So you should be fine putting your validation anywhere you\'d like. It will need to happen when the form action is called, so it will need to be wherever that happens. Something like the following should work: What are the best practices as regards security, if I\'m using a salt or a hash or an encrytion function should that be in an include file?Yes, use an encryption function. It does not need to be in a separate file to be secure: the encryption function is what provides the security, not the fact that the user cannot see the file (read: actual security, not security through obfuscation). But whatever salt you use to hash the value should be in a separate file that is not accessible over the web. If a user can see your hashing algorithm and your salt, they can begin to bruteforce your data. Is jQuery validation a waste of time, would it be better just to do it with PHP?jQuery validation should be considered more of a UI/UX improvement than actual validation. Client-side (read: JavaScript) validation should never replace server-side (read: PHP) validation for the reasons you already mentioned. But I do think that it can contribute to a better user experience, so sometimes it\'s worth doing both.One thing I would do is use the same method for validating server-side and client-side, so that you don\'t have to write your validation code twice. For example, if you place your validation function in another file, you can use AJAX to send the form data to it, then receive back form errors.Hope this helps!Update:Also, if what you\'re doing is logging in users, check out password_compat, which will become part of PHP standard library in PHP 5.5. That library should take care of a lot of security concerns for you, in an upgradable way.'

I guess the only part that bothers me is that I won\'t know in advance how many items I have when i\'m parsing this url.Its possible that I\'ll get none, or all 3 or some value in between. So the method that then has to parse this url will just keep looping until uri->segment() returns false, indicating that it\'s hit the first empty uri segment. Any suggestions would be appreciated.ThanksEDIT 1: Just in case it wasn\'t clear, my model is getting the data from the database and will also build the list. The question is really about parsing an undetermined number of uri segments.Just wondering if there\'s a better way to do this.Thanks!EDIT 2Here\'s some more information to help you understand my MVC app. I don\'t think my issue is the way I\'ve organized my code as far as who is doing what.. But just in case it helps...I have methodA in my model that queries database and passes back to my controller listitem1, listitem2 and listitem2.The controller then builds a string that represents a URL like: Then the view display a hyperlink using the url above. When the user clicks on this hyperlink, it calls methodB. In methodB, I since I don\'t know the number of items, I will just loop through all segments until I hit my first false. As far as why I need to do this / what I\'m doing... here\'s some background info: I\'m query a database for a list of ports on a switch that are considered trunks - ones that should not be modified. this is what method A does. methodB run a command against a switch and it returns a bunch of data back. the view that displays the data from methodB will allow the end user to make further changes to the switch. before I display the data from methodB, i want to filter out the list of ports I got from methodA so they cannot be tampered with. Hope this helps.Edit 3I need both methodA and methodB because they serve two different purposes. methodA displays summary data about ports from my database. Think of methodA as a function that shows documentation about the switch. The view for methodA in turn, provides "live" links to communicate with the actual switch - this is where methodB comes in. methodB is triggered by one of those live links and it goes and gets a list of ports - similar to methodA - except that it represents what actual, and it doesn\'t include user defined information about the port. I guess I can have methodB communicate with my database and filter its data before it displays, but if i want to treat these two functions as separate APIs... aka - one set of functions get data out of the database, the other set is a tool to communicate with switches... - then i don\'t think i want one talking directly to the other. I would like the GUI to tie them together. In fact, i have created two separate models and controllers for what I\'ll call the database interface, and then the switch interface. So far, i think the forms idea is the most elegant solution. Thanks everyone, for reading. '

12590560	b'I\'m guessing you append the text box on each loop iteration... If you can, store everything in a variable and append it to the TextBox once after the loop is finished. Displaying text in a text box takes a lot of time in VB6.EDIT:After further investigation and testing, I came to a conclusion that performance on directly assigning strings to the Text property of a TextBox degrades dramatically when the length of the control reaches maximum. The maximum on my PC is 65535 for some reason, even though according to MSDN its  Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Advanced Server, Windows XP Home Edition, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, Windows Server 2003 Platform Note: For single line text box controls, if the MaxLength property is set to 0, the maximum number of characters the user can enter is 2147483646 or an amount based on available memory, whichever is smallerBasically what seems to be happening, if you keep adding text to the TextBox each iteration, it isn\'t that slow until you reach maximum. What\'s even more puzzling, when you try to add text beyond the maximum, there will be no errors, but performance degrades significantly.In my test loop I go from 0 to 12773 I have this:Text2.Text = Text2.Text + CStr(a) + " "So when the loop is completed in 4 seconds, the Text2.Text is 65534 characters long. Now, when I double the loop to go beyond the maximum allowed length of the TextBox, it takes three times as much time to complete it. 12773 - 4 seconds12773*2 - 16 secondsAfter realizing this, my first thought was to replace the TextBox with a RichTextBox. But the performance of the latter is even worse. This is assuming you update it every iteration.It seems that you are stuck with a dilemma - suffer slow performance or change the code to update text box only once after the loop is completed. Further, due to TextBox\'s maximum length limit, I recommend switching to a RichTextBox or depending on the purpose of this - some other object.I hope my findings are helpful - it has certainly been fun finding out all these little programming quirks.'

12590609	b"As many have said, parsing HTML with regex is not likely to be the ideal method. Still, I've done a bit of research to try to help, under the assumption that you are bound to this approach for some reason.It sounds like you may be running into issues related to how PHP is interpretting the greediness of your regex pattern. I see that you use a lot of ? quantifiers, which may be making this run a non-greedy search (based on what I'm reading at  at least). There is a chance that you can fix this by using the U modifier on some or all of your regex patterns. This will invert the greediness, which could have the effect of making your ? quantifiers greedy again.That said, you have a complicated set of regex checks there, so there is definitely a chance of this causing some unintended behaviors as well. I suggest you test and see.For reference, you would invoke the U modifier by placing it after the closing / of the regex, much like you have done with i and s in some places."

You just want to make reference of all the images you want to have in cache. I normally approach it like this. On document ready create an empty array, add a new Image object for each image to the array, then assign the 'src' property to the image, and then every image you created in the array will be in your cache. This will work across all browsers... Its been tested.I usually create a new array for each page just to keep things organized. I know it might seem like a lot of code but all your images will be cached and you can also reference the image from the array if you need to. Clear your cache, open up your dev tools, click on Network > Images, and you will see the images.Hope this helps!"

12590695	b'I\'m implementing an infinite-scroll, which means I\'m appending chunks of content into the DOM (via jquery and javascript).To make this feel smooth for the user, we need to do some manual scrolling to keep the content window "in the same place", especially as we prepend text in front of what the user is seeing. To accomplish this (prepend a chunk, then scroll the content down by the exact amount we prepended) we need to be able to determine the HEIGHT of the content we just prepended. This is where Firefox and IE differ. Firefox handles this correctly, and scrolls to the correct place in my content, but IE is reporting about 600px as the height when the true value is around 2400px. The alerted value is consistently wrong in IE (off by a factor of 3), and it\'s consistent no matter how I take the measurement (I could instead measure the height of the \'newContent\' after it\'s in the DOM and IE still reports it wrong, but consistently). Even other \'built in\' javascript functions such as .scrollIntoView() seem to be off by exactly this amount in IE. As a sanity check, I can create a stand-alone html file on my desktop with a sample of my content, and in this situation it works.

12590760	b'I\'m working on a very large project and I\'m trying to revisit and solve a problem that I\'ve been having for quite a while: a 4x4 matrix decomposition algorithm.I\'m writing a commercial game &amp; simulation engine. It is an API and platform-agnostic engine written entirely in C#. It uses SlimDX as its DirectX back-end, and I\'m probably going to stick with OpenTK for the OpenGL back-end. Since I cannot depend on DirectX\'s or OpenGL\'s math libraries or data types (e.g., Vector2, Vector3, Quaternion, Matrix, etc) I\'m having to write my own types for the engine. I\'ve gotten everything finished up and pretty well optimized; and the API is semantically similar to XNA because I (and many other people) liked XNA\'s "feel" and felt it was very elegant and powerful. But don\'t be confused; this project does not use and has nothing to do with XNA. Anyway, I was able to handle everything except ONE thing... Matrix.Decompose!!!The problem is, I simply have no idea what I\'m doing on this... I am a self-taught programmer, and self-taught at virtually everything else (business finance, day trading, German, etc). That\'s just how I learn. I only had one year and one semester of college, so I have no formal education in complex mathematics. So when I go on Wikipedia and look at formulas for Matrix decomposition it\'s all Greek to me.... a bunch of funny symbols and diagrams that mean nothing to me lol. I was always a poor math student because math simply escapes me if I can\'t practically apply it to something (like game programming). For instance, I can write a complex ballistics physics simulation but couldn\'t even help my girlfriend with her basic physics and calculus homework lol, because it\'s a bunch of "high-level" theoretical math and I cant bridge the gap to practicality or programming. So I\'m just very lost, don\'t know what I\'m doing and highly frustrated...What I need to do, specifically, is mirror the functionality of Matrix.Decompose found in the XNA Framework and DirectX. I tried to look for the implementation in SlimDX\'s source and OpenTK\'s source, but neither had it implemented! SlimDX just defers the work to the native DirectX libraries and OpenTK simply doesn\'t even have it. As this algorithm is one big, hideously complex beast, I\'m not surprised neither development team wanted to implement their own. But I have to. I\'ve tried turning those whacky formulas on Wikipedia and other sites into a working C# algorithm but I just can\'t make heads or tails of it. I really need to see a working implementation of it in C, C++ or C#, or have someone help me understand this with pseudo-code or something. I just cannot grasp these formulas and "high-level" mathematics theories.

12591002	b'Michael Krelin gave a very compact answer but I think I can expand on it a bit more.In any language, not just C, you need to know the size for a variety of reasons:This determines the maximum value that can be stored The memory space an array of those values will take (1000 bytes will get you 250 ints or 125 longs).When you want to copy one array of values into another, you need to know how many bytes are used to allocate enough space.While you may dereference a pointer and get the value, you could dereference the pointer at a different portion of that value, but only if you know how many bytes it is composed of. You could get the high-value of an int by grabbing just the first two bytes, and the low value by getting the last two bytes.Different architectures may have different sizes for different variables, which would impact all the above points.Edit:Also, there are certainly reasons where you may need to know the number of bits that a given variables is made of. If you want 32 booleans, what not a better variable to use than a single int, which is made of 32 bits? Then you can use some constants to create pointers to each bit and now you have an "array" of booleans. These are usually called bit-fields (correct me if I am wrong). In programming, every detail can matter, just not all the time for every application. Just figured that might be an interesting thought exercise.'
12591005	b'Given a (doubly) linked list of objects (C++), I have an operation that I would like multithread, to perform on each object. The cost of the operation is not uniform for each object. The linked list is the preferred storage for this set of objects for a variety of reasons. The 1st element in each object is the pointer to the next object; the 2nd element is the previous object in the list.I have solved the problem by building an array of nodes, and applying OpenMP. This gave decent performance. I then switched to my own threading routines (based off Windows primitives) and by using InterlockedIncrement() (acting on the index into the array), I can achieve higher overall CPU utilization and faster through-put. Essentially, the threads work by "leap-frog\'ing" along the elements.My next approach to optimization is to try to eliminate creating/reusing the array of elements in my linked list. However, I\'d like to continue with this "leap-frog" approach and somehow use some nonexistent routine that could be called "InterlockedCompareDereference" - to atomically compare against NULL (end of list) and conditionally dereference &amp; store, returning the dereferenced value.I don\'t think InterlockedCompareExchangePointer() will work since I cannot atomically dereference the pointer and call this Interlocked() method. I\'ve done some reading and others are suggesting critical sections or spin-locks. Critical sections seem heavy-weight here. I\'m tempted to try spin-locks but I thought I\'d first pose the question here and ask what other people are doing. I\'m not convinced that the InterlockedCompareExchangePointer() method itself could be used like a spin-lock. Then one also has to consider acquire/release/fence semantics...Ideas? Thanks!'

12591350	b'Here is the Monte Carlo algorithm that I would use (I do not know Javascript well enough to code in it off the top of my head):Generate random values in the range from -1 to 1 for each of the five dimensions.Calculate the Magnitude M, if M=0 or M>1 then reject these values and return to step #1.Normalize the vector to have a Magnitude of 1 (divide each dimension by M).That should give you random unit vectors evenly distributed over the 5-dimensional super-sphere surface.The question has been asked: "Why reject the vector if M>1?"Answer: So that the final vectors will be uniformly distributed across the surface of the unit 5-sphere.Reasoning: What we are generating in the first step is a set of random vectors that are uniformly distributed within the volume of the unit 5-cube. Some of those vectors are also within the volume of the unit 5-sphere and some of them are outside of that volume. If normalized, the vectors within the 5-sphere are evenly distributed across its surface, however, the ones outside it are not at all evenly distributed.Think about it like this: Just as with a normal 3-dimensional Unit Cube and Unit Sphere, or even the Unit Square and the Unit Circle, the Unit 5-Sphere is wholly contained within the Unit 5-Cube, which touches only at the five positive unit dimension axis points:and their corresponding negative unit axis points. This is because these are the only points on the surface of the cube that have a magnitude (distance from the origin) of 1, at all other points, the 5-cube\'s surface has a distance from the origin that is greater than 1.And this means that there are many more points between (0,0,0,0,0) and (1,1,1,1,1) than there are between (0,0,0,0,0) and (1,0,0,0,0). In fact about SQRT(5) or aprx. 2.25 times more. And that means that if you included all of the vectors in the unit 5-cube, you would end up with more than twice as many results "randomly" mapping to about (0.44,0.44,0.44,0.44,0.44) than to (1,0,0,0,0).For those who are challenging (without foundation, IMHO) that this results in a uniform distribution across the surface of the 5-D Sphere, please see the Wikipedia article: '

12591418	b"I think Casta has some good points, and I'll pony up one myself. The solution to this problem is going to weight heavily on the idealogical transformations done at each node, whether they're interdependent, and whether the accomplished task can be done in a singular sweep of the list.If the operations are not interdependent, and the sweep-approach makes sense, I propose a brokered fetch system. It is virtually identical to a work-crew approach. Each thread is handed a reference to the broker, which manages the list, As each thread needs content to process it requests it from the broker, which locks, obtains the next node, advances the internal sweep iterator, and releases the lock, returning the node to the requesting thread. This continues until the list enumeration is finished. For accumulator problems where each node may be visited more than once by a different thread, you can use a circular list or some other such container. A talented broker can manage the list, including new inserts, deletes, etc, in the same fashion as it dispatches: lock, action, unlock. There are obviously many activities that can be tailored to your specific needs on the broker side. What those needs are can make for an elaborate pool management system, while still be very efficient in terms of locking contention (i.e. almost none).Bottom line, however, is hopefully evident. Know your problem set and the specifics of what you want each thread to accomplish with its current node. "

The main trick is that str(f)\xe2\x80\x94that is, the human-readable rendition of a floating-point number\xe2\x80\x94is truncated to 12 significant digits, so str(5.2-5.0) is "0.2", not "0.20000000000000018".

12591817	b"You say you've learned math when it has served a practical purpose, so I'm sure solving simple systems of equations (a+b=3, a-b=1) comes quite naturally to you. You can think of linear algebra as just a systematic way of solving and manipulating such systems of equations (although it turns out systems of equations can get a lot deeper than you'd think). Many introductory linear algebra courses (usually a sophomore class in college) take this path when teaching, so you might find it helpful to give it a try.Try some basic Khan Academy lectures on linear algebra and matrices (they place a lot of emphasis on intuition). MIT OpenCourseWare has Gilbert Strang's lectures on linear algebra, although it can get a bit technical, if you can filter out the things you don't need then it should help you out as well. Other well-known schools also put their own video lectures online nowadays.For actually doing exercises and playing around with matrices, I'd recommend using Octave, the free clone of Matlab, and following some basic Matrix manipulation tutorials on the internet (Matlab documentation is very well written, and Octave can run most Matlab code). These are written with a very non-technical audience in mind (ie. scientists who can't program but need to do simulations). Matlab's syntax is tailor made for doing linear algebra so using Octave be a tremendous help when learning, and something many students unfortunately manage without (solving matrix problems on paper is the worst of tortures).As someone who does have formal training, I have found that linear algebra libraries and algorithms used in practice tend to be extremely easy to understand once you know the vocabulary and main concepts (which are really simple enough that a child of 10 could grasp the basics with a good explanation).Also, wikipedia is awful for learning math - the articles are usually very concerned with formal correctness and rigor, so subject matter is presented in the most general (read: hardest to understand) forms, proper motivation is not provided before the problem is explored, and articles don't start out with simple examples and work their way up into recovering the more complicated invented methods. It's great for reference if you are familiar with the topic, but otherwise, better look elsewhere."

12591838	b"At the risk of being obvious, you basically want to just drop the else clause. The logic you're looking for is something like:This actually lets you change the value of max_active without restarting, which is the only justification for the for loop around the wait() call.The obvious complaint is that number_active in my version doesn't actually tell you how many processes are active, which is true. It tells you how many processes you haven't wait()'ed for, which means that you might keep some zombies (but the number is limited). If you're constantly running at or close to the maximum number of tasks, this doesn't matter, and unless your maximum is huge, it doesn't matter anyway, since the only Design Requirement was that you don't use more than the maximum number of tasks, and consequently you only have to know that the number active is not more than the maximum.If this really bothers you and you want to clean the tasks up, you can put:before the other for loop, which will reap the zombies before checking if you need to block.

That will ensure that the call dosn't block.This will add a new problem: You will have to check for yourself is any child process have terminated.

Macros have two features that can help make life much easier, the single hash \'#\' which can turn a parameter into a string, i.e. #_name will be translated into "fieldName1" and the double hash \'##\' which concatenate parameters with other things which in turn can expand new things, i.e. STRUCT_##_type##_str that will be translated into STRUCT_int_str which will be translated into "%d" First wrap the structure or "description" in macros i.e. into an own file (the-struct.def)Then one can define the macros differently in places where one want to declare or implement things that should handle the struct. i.e.and to make a function that prints the structother uses can be to auto-generate functions to ie swap bytes etc.Made a small example as a gist here https://gist.github.com/3786323'

In other words, in the method for calculating the X values, write:without any of the parentheses. Similarly, when calculating the Y values, writeIf that doesn't help, then please post some actual numbers, so that we can see which calculations might be causing loss of significance.

In this case it would create a new jpg file stopping at the ff d9 and then attempt to write the stripped data to the XML (via the elementTree lib): changeString.text =str(excessData)Of course this wont work as the XML writer is looking to write ASCII not binary dumps.In the above case, the error is UnicodeDecodeError: \'ascii\' codec can\'t decode byte 0xff in position 0: ordinal not in range(128) which I can see if because its not a valid ASCII characterMy question therefore, is how do I elegantly deal with this raw data, in a way it can stored and used in the future?

Is this even possible on Android?ANALOGIESin the web world the equivalent is an element which has \'position: absolute\' and is thus not counted as part of the "flow" (ie: layout)in the WPF world the equivalent would be an element which is positioned inside a Canvas. The Canvas has its own bounds which take up space in the layout but its children can lie outside of its bounds and not affect the layoutin the iOS world every view is positioned as a canvas (since there are no layout managers) so this behavior is achieved bysimply offsetting the element frame\'s x and y properties'

I just started with the language about two weeks ago.I have tried looking for an answer to this questions, but so far I haven't found one so that is why I am asking it here.I writing java code for an Dungeons and Dragons Initiative Tracker and I am using a TreeMap for its ability to sort on entry. I am still very new to java, so I don't know everything that is out there.My problem is that when I have two of the same keys, the tree merges the values such that one of the values no longer exists. I understand this can be desirable behavior but in my case I cannot have that happen. I was hoping there would be an elegant solution to fix this behavior. So far what I have is this:Character is a class that I have defined that keeps track of a player's character name and initiative values.Currently the output is this:I considered using a TreeMap with some sort of subCollection but I would also run into a similar problem. What I really need to do is just find a way to disable the merge. Thank you guys for any help you can give me.EDIT: In Dungeons and Dragons, a character rolls a 20 sided dice and then added their initiative mod to the result to get their total initiative. Sometimes two players can get the same values. I've thought about having the key formatted like this:So for Sam his key would be 23.3 and John's would be 23.2. I understand that I would need to change the key type to float instead of int.However, even with that two players could have the same Initiative Mod and roll the same Initiative Value. In reality this happens more than you might think. So for example,Say both Peter and Scott join the game. They both have an initiative modifier of 2, and they both roll a 10 on the 20 sided dice. That would make both of their Initiative values 12.When I put them into the existing map, they both need to show up even though they have the same value. I hope that helps to clarify what I am needing."

12592987	b'In general, it is never true that "the race is OK". A data race, defined as a simultaneous write and read of an ordinary variable, is undefined behavior under every threading model I know (including Visual C++, POSIX threads, and C++11).That said, since you mentioned you are using Visual C++, you can get away with declaring your shared variable "volatile". Microsoft\'s documentation says: When the /volatile:ms compiler option is used\xe2\x80\x94by default when architectures other than ARM are targeted\xe2\x80\x94the compiler generates extra code to maintain ordering among references to volatile objects in addition to maintaining ordering to references to other global objects. In particular:  A write to a volatile object (also known as volatile write) has Release semantics; that is, a reference to a global or static object that occurs before a write to a volatile object in the instruction sequence will occur before that volatile write in the compiled binary.  A read of a volatile object (also known as volatile read) has Acquire semantics; that is, a reference to a global or static object that occurs after a read of volatile memory in the instruction sequence will occur after that volatile read in the compiled binary.  This enables volatile objects to be used for memory locks and releases in multithreaded applications.This at least makes the behavior well-defined. You still have a race condition in the sense that multiple threads can all log the message, but it is not a "data race" in the "undefined behavior" sense.As for why a thread might not "see its own updates", without synchronization a thread might "speculatively store" to the address for performance. That is, the compiler might emit code like this:This is a legal transformation for a single-threaded program as long as the compiler can prove that isShutdownNecessary() does not access shutDownRequested. The compiler (or CPU) might believe this speculative version is faster. But then in the multi-threaded case, it can result in the behavior you are seeing. A disassembly would let you know for sure...This sort of speculative execution, which tends to get more aggressive with every generation of compilers and CPUs, is one of the reasons "data races" very specifically invoke undefined behavior. You just do not want go there if your code has any chance of living beyond next week.The volatile declaration will prevent Visual Studio from making this kind of transformation. But the only way to fix this across platforms is to do proper locking with a mutex (and possibly a condition variable if this is a busy loop). The details for those differ between platforms prior to C++11.'

12593162	b"You can use array_map which will do the looping in C but require calling back to PHP for each iteration.Better?The above code is more expressive to me and probably most functional programmers, but that's subjective.

You can get around that for PHP 5.2 and below by declaring a global function, but then you lose much of the clarity, especially when the code appears in a class.Faster?In this simple case with the callback, it seems to be slower (see Esben's answer). However, I have two caveats here.Micro-benchmarks are notoriously finicky. They vary from machine to machine and depend on the particular build of the interpreter. But worse, measuring such a small value can be overshadowed by other tasks such as processor multitasking, memory management, etc. The times also varied considerably between using the callback versus the global function.Developer time is far costlier than CPU cycles. You're better off writing the easiest-to-code and maintain solution first and only optimizing it once you've a) found it to be a problem and b) measured how much of a problem it is. Obviously this is much less important for this simple case, but it's a general rule I've learned to follow."

It would certainly have the potential to spoil the global namespace if it is not strict mode code and the implementation is conforming to ECMAScript Ed. 5.x there.)But this approach actually comes from a really viral bad example in the old Netscape JavaScript 1.3 Guide (mirrored at Oracle, formerly Sun).This way, your WeatherWidget instances will all inherit from the same Widget instance:This can be useful, but most of the time you would not want it to happen. You should not do that here unless you want all your WeatherWidget instances to share among them the property values they inherit from this Widget instance, and only through it, from Widget.prototype. Another problem is that you need to call the parent constructor this way, which may not allow to be called without arguments as you do, or would not initialize properly. It certainly has nothing to do with emulation of class-based inheritance as known, e.g., from Java.The proper way to implement class-based inheritance in these prototype-based languages is (originally devised by Lasse Reichstein Nielsen in comp.lang.javascript in 2003, for cloning objects):(The constructor prototype property should be fixed as well, so that your WeatherWidget instances w would have w.constructor === WeatherWidget as expected, and not w.constructor === Widget. However, be aware that it is enumerable afterwards.)This way, WeatherWidget instances will inherit properties through the prototype chain, but will not share property values among them, because they inherit from Widget.prototype through Dummy which has no own properties:The parent constructor will only be called if you call it explicitly, from WeatherWidget, for example with(If you are in a very restricted environment that requires compliance with ECMAScript Ed. 5 and later \xe2\x80\x93 so not on the Web \xe2\x80\x93 or when implementations of ECMAScript Edition 5.1 have become ubiquitous \xe2\x80\x93 in 10 years or so from now, given that it took Edition 3 that long \xe2\x80\x93, you can and should use WeatherWidget.prototype = Object.create(Widget.prototype, {constructor: {value: WeatherWidget}}); instead.)See also Function.prototype.extend() in my JSX:object.js for how to generalize this.

The abstract properties are those that are visible to client code that makes use of the data type\xe2\x80\x94the interface to the data type\xe2\x80\x94while the concrete implementation is kept entirely private, and indeed can change, for example to incorporate efficiency improvements over time. The idea is that such changes are not supposed to have any impact on client code, since they involve no difference in the abstract behaviour.For example, one could define an abstract data type called lookup table which uniquely associates keys with values, and in which values may be retrieved by specifying their corresponding keys. Such a lookup table may be implemented in various ways: as a hash table, a binary search tree, or even a simple linear list of (key:value) pairs. As far as client code is concerned, the abstract properties of the type are the same in each case.Consider for example a sample Java fragment to represent some common farm "animals" to a level of abstraction suitable to model simple aspects of their hunger and feeding. It defines an Animal class to represent both the state of the animal and its functions:With the above definition, one could create objects of type Animal and call their methods like this:'

In some cases, the abstraction provided is almost pure data, with functions only to provide access to the data (e.g., collection classes). Other cases are nearly the opposite (e.g., the abstraction provided by a functor in C++ is typically pretty much a function).Those, of course, are pretty much the extremes -- many (most?) classes fall somewhere between them.'

On every 3rd iteration of the loop I have it switches the place of my contact 1 and partner in the lists. It only seems to be switching two of them out of order. So if I have 3 contacts it switches the contact1 and contact2 and on the ones where I only have 2 contacts it is switching the order of them.Here is my new mysql statement I'm using.For my display I have an if statement to check whether there is a contact1, contact2 and partner. If the contact 2 is empty it will only display contact 1 and partner, while if contact 2 is present it will show all 3 contacts, and an else statement that will show only the partner if there is no contact1 or contact2. The php looping through this works perfectly so there is no error in that. It is the reference to and/or the sql statement that isn't quite right yet that is causing my error. For each loop through I allow the statement to run and when it hits the second (if there is one) contact to fetch the row again. I set a variable equal to the staff_id so that I can have it pull the correct people associated with each location. Before I have it fetch the row I set the staff id to the particular contact example:It reads the assignment correct but for some reason it seems to be hitting the fetch assoc call before it reads the assignment to the staff id. Effectively setting the staff id to the second name in the list rather than the first.Any ideas?Edit to include the php loop:"

12594055	b'When playing checkers, you seek to gain an advantage over your opponent by taking his or her pieces and crowning your own. Losing your pieces and allowing your opponent to crown his or her pieces is not desirable, so you avoid doing it.Board game engines usually revolve around a position evaluation function. For checkers, my first guess would be something like this:Given a board, this function will return the score of the board. The higher the score, the better your position. The lower the score, the worse your position.To make a naive checkers "engine", all you need to do is find the best move given a board position, which is just searching through all immediate legal moves and finding the one that maximizes your score.Your engine won\'t think ahead more than one move, but it will be able to play against you somewhat.The next step would to give your engine the ability to plan ahead, which essentially is predicting your opponent\'s responses. To do that, just find your opponent\'s best move (here comes recursion) and subtract it from your score.'

12594124	b"Sorry for long answer. Judging by your code, I assume you are new to Django, so this answer hopefully will be informative as well as in the process answer question.UserIn your review model, user should be a ForeignKey instead of a CharField. I understand that it seems more natural to store a username, especially if you will be looking at the database table yourself, however that approach is error-prone and unless you have a very good reason, a bad thing to do.Imagine you have a user whose username is foousername. Then that user creates a couple of reviews. So at this point you will have a couple of reviews where the user field will be foousername. Now if the user will want to change his/her username to someotherfoousername, in order not to break the link between reviews and the user, you will have to change user field for all the reviews which the user created to use the new username. That is an extra step, which you might forget to do, therefore it is error prone. Using ForeignKey solves this issue right away. Even if the user changes his/her username, the primary id of the user will not change, so if reviews link to primary keys (which is what foreign key is), reviews do not have to be updated. So less work, and more reliable method.So do this (will explain related_name next):related_nameWhen you are using related_name, Django makes your life a lot easier.Consider your view. First you query the product. Then once you get it, you take it's id and then you construct a query which will return all reviews for that product. Using Django you can do all of that using much less code.This however is a bit confusing because of the whole _set business. This is where related name comes in. If you define your product field as follows:then you can do the same in a bit more readable way (and Python should be readable...):User's profileForeign keys allow to implement one-to-many relationships. So for products and reviews it makes perfect sense. One product can have many reviews. However usually that is not the case for user profiles. Usually a user has only one user profile. So within your user profile, you should not have ForeignKey to a user, but instead should use OneToOneField like so:That allows you to easily access user's profile:User's imageFor each review, now since the user is ForeignKey as per my first explanation, you can access user's image very easily:Image URLWhenever you use FileField in Django, it uploads the files into upload_to place under your media folder - the one defined in MEDIA_ROOT in your project settings. So in your case, Django will store images in images folder within your media folder. In addition, if you configure MEDIA_URL, that allows to access file's url like:Hard-coded URLsIts a very bad idea to include direct urls within your templates. Thats what url pattern names are for. So the idea is that you assign to url pattern a name, so that later on you get the url by referencing a name. That makes the code much more maintainable. For example, the following is a url-pattern for a user:This allows you to use it like so in templates:Putting everything togetherandand"

12594305	b'This answer applies to EA 9.3. I don\'t have an old EA 8 lying around but EA is eminently backwards-compatible, so you should upgrade in any case.There are a couple of ways to follow inheritance chains in EA.Method 1: add classes to the same diagram.In a diagram containing the root class of your inheritance hierarchy, right-click the root class and select Add - Related Elements. In the "Insert Related Elements" dialog, select the length of chain ("levels") you want, up to a maximum of 5. Specify "link type" Generalization. You can leave the other options as they are, or play around with them if you like.This will cause EA to add those classes to the diagram which inherit from the root class in up to 5 steps/levels. You don\'t have to start from a root class; the option "link direction" in the dialog controls whether relationships should be followed in one or both directions.You can use this same function to add classes related through other relationships, such as aggregations.Method 2: Use the Traceability window.In the main menu, select View - Traceability. This opens the Traceability window, which is a tree view with the currenty selected element at the top, and nodes for all related elements in a hierarchy.Select the root class and viol\xc3\xa0, all its inheriting classes are shown as child nodes in the Traceability window, and you can expand them in turn to follow the chains further.Method 1 puts the information in diagrams, where it is kept and needs to be updated. Method 2 is dynamic and more usefu when you need to check a specific relationship chain.The relationships in a diagram are automatically updated if the underlying model changes, so if for instance you change the code and reimport it, this will be reflected in the diagram. To be on the safe side, always work with manually created diagrams in a separate package from the source package.'
12594314	b'Method 1: If you just need to know if a given number is in the list, and the maximum value is not too big, you could consider using bit field. The look up would be O(1) operation then.Method 2: If the range of values is huge (small and big integers in it), but the list size is not big (e.g. couple of thousands), you could try (programmatically) crafting a hash function that is one-to-one on the values of in the list;will give a value of range 0 ... N + m with m small enough;relatively inexpensive to calculate.The values of the constant list could then be put in an array, indexed by the hash value, for quick check of inclusion for a given input value. If there are holes in the list (m non-zero), then the holes should be indicated by special value (e.g. -1).Inclusion test: for a given input 1. calculate hash value; 2. if the value of the hash value is out of range, the input is not in the list; 3. otherwise the input belongs to the list if and only if the value in the generated array indexed by the hash value is the same as the input value. How to craft the hash function is worth another question in SO (for string values there exist tools to generate tools for this purpose). :-)Limitation: If the list is not created in compile time, but calculated or received in run time of the program, then this method is not suitable. Also if this list is changing frequently, then the computational time required to generate the hash function and the code could make this approach unsuitable.'

When it finishes linking, it realizes that it\'s missing those symbols and emits the error.Typically, this occurs when you have a library you link to which does not have matching ARCHS flags specified. Since Xcode 4.5 dropped armv6 and added support for armv7s, you may get different values depending on the toolchains you used to build the libraries.The way around it is to open the project which compiles those symbols, and update its ARCHS to match your project\'s ARCHS.'

12594670	b"Ok, I am new with CSS and this is just causing me trouble. How do I add a background color to multiple columns but not all columns. I want one background color on span2 and a different color on span10. The problem I run into is issues with padding. When I apply the background to certain columns it won't have a nice even padding around the content. Does this make sense? How do I add a background to certain columns with nested columns and still maintain nice even padding? HTMLCSSExplanationSo the bg class is applying the background. Then my nested columns have weird padding, so I went through and added classes like right-pad to the columns that need right padding and bot-pad to columns that need padding on the bottom. I know how incredibly wrong this is semantically, I just don't know how else to get my needed results.

12594710	b'As a general rule there is a quick and dirty way to test your site. The dirty assumption is that if it works on IE, it will work in anything since IE handles more things differently than other browsers. With that being said, you can test on IE by opening up an IE9 browser window and hitting F12. This will bring up a box on the bottom that allows you to check the site for compatibility quickly. On the top right hand corner of the box that popped up there are two drop down menus to change the IE engine that is interpreting the site (The one on the left is the Engine and the one right is compatibility mode that the engine is running). You can switch between IE7 engine to IE9 engine seamlessly and without needing a 3rd party application to do so. '

12594730	b'If by "your application shuts down" you mean the process is terminating, then you technically don\'t need to do anything. Your process is terminating and the OS is going to free up those resources.I imagine their could be some obscure corner cases where some component could create some type of file or other resource and if Dispose is not called, that won\'t necessarily be cleaned up, even if your process terminates.I\'d like to give an example of this, albeit this is a bizarre corner case. Let\'s say you reference and use a component in your code. When you create and use this, it creates a 2GB file on your machine. Now let\'s take it a step further and say that this component, actually closes the file handle itself accessing this 2GB file sometime during it\'s use, due to a bug or just bad design. Now the Dispose method on this object cleans up this file, but it is not well-documented. Essentially, missing the Dispose call to this will leave a file on the machine. This is definitely a corner case and won\'t cause your machine to "leak" anything, but you do have a 2GB file just sitting there.That being said - the best practice is to call Dispose when you are deterministically done with your resource(s). You could call a method on your Singleton - let\'s say Cleanup() - that can run when you are shutting down.'

12594800	b"If the total range is not huge, you could build a sampled index array of any convenient size (how much RAM do you want to throw at it?)So, for example, if the total range of the data is 256M, and you have a spare megabyte, then you store the positions of every 1K interval of the data range. Then for any given data point, you do a O(1) (actually O(2) :) ) probe into the index array to find the lowest and highest plausible ranges for that data point, and then you can do lowest_bound on just that range. If your ranges are not wildly variable in size, that should give you average constant time lookup.If you don't want to throw that much memory at the problem, you could try a pair of linear estimates based on the average range size and a fuzz factor. If that turns out not to contain a particular datapoint, you can fall back to a full binary search; otherwise, again, a binary search inside the restricted range should be average linear time.Here's the first suggestion, in case the handwaving wasn't clear enough. Totally untested code, didn't even try compiling it, and the use of integer types is, too say the least, sloppy. If you use it, try to make it more beautiful. Also I should have (but didn't) restrict the start of the indexed range to *begin_; if that's significantly greater than 0, you should fix it."

12594803	b'Well, whether you should test your website against:all browsers: Yes, because Windows users have any among IE, Chrome, Firefox &amp; in remote cases, Safari, Opera among others. Whereas Mac users will have Safari, Chrome as their preferred one.all versions: Probably no. Limit yourself to only those which are still supported, i.e. IE 7 onwards &amp; so on.But, the key lies in the engine upon which the browser is based upon. It can be said:For instance, Chrome, Safari, both are based upon "webkit" layout engine.Check out, web-layout engines: (This consideration will save a lot of effort as you can be rest assured that browsers using same engine will behave in a similar manner.)Also, keep in consideration your target audience, this can help you limit your browser choices.And yeah, most browsers have developer tools (F12 key), which allow you to simulate the previous versions of the browser.But, all in all, the answer is relative &amp; depends solely upon how much time you have &amp; how much effort, time, testing are you willing to spend...'
12594808	b'This is a complicated question, and the answer depends on how far down you go (in abstraction layers) to answer it. Ultimately, your USB keyboard device is being polled once per millisecond by the computer to ask what keys are being held down. This information gets passed to the keyboard driver through a CPU interrupt when the USB device (in the computer) gets a packet of data from the keyboard. From then on, interrupts are used to pass the data from process to process (through the GUI framework) and eventually reach your application.As Marc Cohen said in his answer, CPU interrupts are also raised to signal I/O completion. This is an example of something which has no polling until you get to the hardware level, where checks are performed (perhaps once per clock cycle? Someone with more experience with computer architecture should answer) to see if the event has taken place.'

A regular download link/button will always invoke the standard download process of the browser, in which you have no say whether the file will be saved at all or where to. The only way to circumvent that is to create a native browser plugin which the user will have to install first, which will write files from your site straight to a specific location on disk. Please be extremly careful writing such a plugin should you do so so it does not become a gaping security hole for everybody. "

I see you do that with a call to malloc but then you overwrite that with an explicit assignment from str. Instead you should copy the contents of str (using strcpy) into the dynamically allocated memory via: strcpy(tokenizer->tks, str);"

12595395	b'Answer is $_SERVER[\'HTTP_REFERER\'] When a web browser moves from one website to another and between pages of a website, it can optionally pass the URL it came from. This is called the HTTP_REFERER, and this post looks at how to use this variable with PHP.Overview of http referersMost web browsers pass the HTTP_REFERER variable by default, but in many this behaviour can be changed to not show it or to pass something else instead. There is also 3rd party anti-spyware etc software that can be installed on a user\'s computer which also prevents the referrer information from being passed to the web server. Because it can also be changed to something else, the HTTP_REFERER cannot be trusted, but it is still useful for working out where people have come from.Appearance in log filesThe following examples are from an Apache web server\'s log files.The first example shows what a log entry looks like from someone coming from this website\'s homepage to this particular post. I have made the HTTP REFERER part of the log line bold (you\'ll need to scroll to the right to see it).1 192.168.1.10 - - [16/Apr/2008:16:12:36 +1200] "GET /php-http-referer-variable/ HTTP/1.1" 200 2014 "http://www.electrictoolbox.com/" Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.5; Linux) KHTML/3.5.8 (like Gecko)"The second example shows the same thing, but because it is represented by a - only it tells us the user has either gone directly to that page by typing the address in or using a bookmark etc, or is masking the HTTP REFERER with a browser option or a 3rd party tool.1 192.168.1.10 - - [16/Apr/2008:16:12:36 +1200] "GET /php-http-referer-variable/ HTTP/1.1" 200 2014 "-" Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.5; Linux) KHTML/3.5.8 (like Gecko)"Using HTTP_REFERER in PHPThe HTTP REFERER in PHP is stored in the $_SERVER super global, and can be referenced from anywhere in your PHP code like in the following example, which would simply write it out to the browser:1 echo $_SERVER[\'HTTP_REFERER\']If the HTTP_REFERER has been set then it will be displayed. If it is not then you won\'t see anything. If it\'s not set and you have error reporting set to show notices, you\'ll see an error like this instead:1 Notice: Undefined index: HTTP_REFERER in /path/to/filename.php on line 3To prevent this error when notices are on (I always develop with notices on), you can do this:1 if(isset($_SERVER[\'HTTP_REFERER\'])) {2 echo $_SERVER[\'HTTP_REFERER\'];3 }Another way is like this:1 echo isset($_SERVER[\'HTTP_REFERER\']) ? $_SERVER[\'HTTP_REFERER\'] : \'\';The use of the ? operator will return the first value after the ? if the condition is true and the second value if the condition is false. It can be useful to use when you are wanting to assign the value of the HTTP_REFERER to a variable. e.g.:1 $referer = isset($_SERVER[\'HTTP_REFERER\']) ? $_SERVER[\'HTTP_REFERER\'] : \'\';ConclusionIt can be useful to use the HTTP_REFERER variable for logging etc purposes using the $_SERVER[\'HTTP_REFERER\'] superglobal variable. However it is important to know it\'s not always set so if you program with notices on then you\'ll need to allow for this in your code. The above examples show one way of doing this.'

Otherwise you have this "novel" problem to solve but also potentially introduce security problems. I.e. for any one user to be able to edit your config files - they must be writeable to the webserver user. That opens the door to injecting malicious code into this file from a web exploit - or simply someone with direct access to your server (shared host?) finding this writeable file and updating it to their liking (e.g. putting "&lt;?php header(\'Location: my site\'); die;" in it).One config variableIf you must manage it with a config file, include the file to read it, and var_export the variables to write it. That\'s easiest to do if there is only one config variable, that is an array. e.g.:Allow partial updatesIf you are changing only some variables - just include the config file before rewriting it:Multiple config variablesIf you have more than one variable in your config file, make use of get defined vars and loop on them to write the file back:The above code makes use of variable variables, to overwrite once of the variables in the config file. Each of these last two examples can easily be adapted to update multiple variables at the same time.'
12595512	b' how do you know when you need to combine the byte arrays received in both calls?You need to decide this at the protocol level. There are four common models:Close-on-finish: each side can only send a single "message" per connection. After sending the message, they close the sending side of the socket. The receiving side keeps reading until it reaches the end of the stream.Length-prefixing: Before each message, include the number of bytes in the message. This could be in a fixed-length format (e.g. always 4 bytes) or some compressed format (e.g. 7 bits of size data per byte, top bit set for the final byte of size data). Then there\'s the message itself. The receiving code will read the size, then read that many bytes.Chunking: Like length-prefixing, but in smaller chunks. Each chunk is length-prefixed, with a final chunk indicating "end of message"End-of-message signal: Keep reading until you see the terminator for the message. This can be a pain if the message has to be able to include arbitrary data, as you\'d need to include an escaping mechanism in order to represent the terminator data within the message.Additionally, less commonly, there are protocols where each message is always a particular size - in which case you just need to keep going until you\'ve read that much data.In all of these cases, you basically need to loop, reading data into some sort of buffer until you\'ve got enough of it, however you determine that. You should always use the return value of Read to note how many bytes you actually read, and always check whether it\'s 0, in which case you\'ve reached the end of the stream.Also note that this doesn\'t just affect network streams - for anything other than a local MemoryStream (which will always read as much data as you ask for in one go, if it\'s in the stream at all), you should assume that data may only become available over the course of multiple calls.'

12595598	b"It is not possible to achieve perfectly accurate comparisons of numbers when using float values in Python. This is because floating point values are inherently limited in precision.In your example, the number 1.5999999999999999999999 will have the same floating point representation as 1.6 (as mentioned by nneonneo in a comment). What may be more surprising to you is that the floating point representation is not exactly equal to either of the source numbers (to 20 decimal places, it is 1.60000000000000008882). Python conceals this a bit from you, since if you print the number out it will display 1.6 even though it is slightly larger.The extra bit at the end is rounding error, because there is not any non-repeating binary representation of 1.6. Just like one third can only be represented exactly by an infinitely repeating decimal, 1.6 requires an infinite number of bits to represent exactly in binary. The error comes from stopping the representation after a certain number of digits and rounding the rest (like representing 1/3 as 0.333333, and rounding down the rest of the repeating 3s).There are a number of ways that you can write code to mitigate the effects of floating point errors, but you can't make them go away entirely, except, I suppose, by not using floating point values for situations where extremely high precision is required. In Python, if you want more precision (at the cost of some performance) you can instead use the Decimal class from the standard library:"

This produces much more clear code than nested if/then/else or switch statements.To illustrate this point, let's assume you have a complex conditional logic such as this one:Instead of writing this piece of logic procedurally, we could use the Strategy pattern to decompose it into different entity processing strategies. First we need to define an interface which will be shared from all entity processing strategies:Then we create a concrete strategy implementation for each of our conditional cases, encapsulating the specific processing logic:Our previous code could be thus simplified removing the conditionals, like so:Note that in my last example i have included an EntityProcessingStrategies class which serves as a factory of concrete strategies. More specifically, it can be something like:This is one way to create concrete strategy instances but it's by no means the only way."

For example, while strerror_r mentions that it is a thread safe version of strerror, strerror itself says nothing about thread safety ... what it says instead is "the string might be overwritten", which merely implies that it isn\'t thread-safe.

12596314	b'The way to do such things in Globalize.js is to read the string using one locale, write it using another locale. You need to check the success of reading by some test that checks against null value (since this value signals an error). Like this:This parses just the month abbreviation, or \xe2\x80\x9cshort name\xe2\x80\x9d of month.The problem is with the variation inside cultures. For example, for Romanian language, the short name of September is \xe2\x80\x9csep.\xe2\x80\x9d in Globalize.js data (mainly based on .NET data; Datejs is probably based on the same data here) but \xe2\x80\x9csept.\xe2\x80\x9d in CLDR data, and your example mentions \xe2\x80\x9cSet\xe2\x80\x9d!Globalize.js reads names case-insensitively, but otherwise it uses the exact string in its locale definitions (e.g., \xe2\x80\x9csep\xe2\x80\x9d won\xe2\x80\x99t do if the definition says \xe2\x80\x9csep.\xe2\x80\x9d). There are various ways around this. At the simplest, edit the locale definitions in Globalize.js to match those used in your data. Alternatively, you can create an alternate locale (a variant) with different month names and parse the name using it if it does not parse according to the basic locale. So this is a way to allow, on input, different sets of month names for a language.Of course, if it\xe2\x80\x99s only a matter of mapping short month names from different languages into English, you could simply write the code for it directly. But you would still need to get the names into your objects from somewhere \xe2\x80\x93 from .NET, from CLDR, or from your actual data.'

12596492	b"Possible ways to understand your questionYour code if (dM == M) currently compares pointers. So you're currently checking whether or not the two pointers indicate the same chunk of memory.Your question title suggests that you want to compare single numbers. After all, an uint8_t is just a single number in the range 0 - 255. If you have pointers to such numbers, you'd have to dereference them to get at the actual numbers, like if (*dM == *M).But your code suggests that you actually want to compare memory regions. Dereferencing a pointer to an array is the same as accessing the first element of the array (i.e. the same as if (dM[0] == M[0])), which probably is not what you want.Comparing memory regionsYou can use memcmp to compare the content of memory regions:This means \xe2\x80\x9cif the lengths are the same, and the content of the two memory regions is the same as well\xe2\x80\x9d. If the result of memcmp is nonzero, its sign provides information as to which value is considered greater.PrintingNote that the %p in your printf calls is probably wrong: %p is for printing pointers, but as you're dereferencing them in the function call, you're actually printing values. So %u is much more suitable. If you want to print the content of e.g. M, you'll have to use a loop like this:This will print a hexadecimal representation of your data, with 32 bytes (= 64 hexadecimal digits) per line. The %02x format instructs printf to allways use two digits for every byte, padding with zero as required."

If the replacement is the same length as the template, you can use the methods highlighted in the first link you provided and then just use core graphics to draw the replacement at the correct location for the coordinate.If the replacement text is variable, then you are trying to insert the text into the old pdf. As far as i know, this is non-trivial, unless you use very low level libraries like libharu.Here is an alternative solution for you, which may suit your needs, and which I am using.Firstly, store your template as a HTML file.Put placeholders in your HTML file for the text you will replace.Load the template, replace the text, then use the following method to get your pdf.Create a PDF context to data.create a markup text print formatter, in this case the parameter html is your fully replaced html template page.The markup formatter is what apple provide for you to print html, but you can also use it to print a pdf. You need to subclass a UIPrintPageRenderer in order to do this. So assume you have created your subclass, here is what the rest of the call will look like, Ill show you the subclass below.print to pdf is a call that takes the number of pages you want to print. If you don't know this in advance, the best way to make sure it all looks nice, is to have your template broken into pages, and to perform this process for each page. Anyway, after this call, you should have a pdf which you can save out with the following.Here is the subclassed renderer that I use.implementationlet me know if you have questions, or if it helped, or if it didn't."

When using the cancellation token it will finish (as I am not using a "big" loop in the task, I can\'t just check every iteration for .IsCancelled.My idea was to use the return type of the Task to fill the SelectableVolts and check the returning Task on IsCancelled before assigning the new value.

This is an important to resolve the conflict between Maven\'s build ordering and the old approach to module binaries, where the assembly was build from the parent POM.So I updated your assembly file to this (added &lt;useAllReactorProjects/&gt;) and got it working:&lt;assembly xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/assembly/1.1.2" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/assembly/1.1.2 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/assembly-1.1.2.xsd"&gt; &lt;id&gt;dist&lt;/id&gt; &lt;formats&gt; &lt;format&gt;tar.gz&lt;/format&gt; &lt;/formats&gt; &lt;moduleSets&gt; &lt;moduleSet&gt; &lt;useAllReactorProjects&gt;true&lt;/useAllReactorProjects&gt; &lt;includes&gt; &lt;include&gt;*:a&lt;/include&gt; &lt;/includes&gt; &lt;binaries&gt; &lt;outputDirectory&gt;package&lt;/outputDirectory&gt; &lt;dependencySets&gt; &lt;dependencySet&gt; &lt;excludes&gt; &lt;exclude&gt;*:*&lt;/exclude&gt; &lt;/excludes&gt; &lt;/dependencySet&gt; &lt;/dependencySets&gt; &lt;/binaries&gt; &lt;/moduleSet&gt; &lt;/moduleSets&gt;&lt;/assembly&gt;NB I have removed the tag &lt;attachmentClassifier&gt;jar-with-dependencies&lt;/attachmentClassifier&gt; since it is completely wrong.The output is a .tar.gz which I think is what you want to achieve although that jar-with-dependencies is somewhat pointing in another direction.

12596882	b"Okay, so I'm building an universal iOS app with an initial login view (view controller named LoginVC), just a plain simple UIViewController. If the login is successful the app segues to an navigation controller (MainNavigationVC). I created this segue through the storyboard gui of XCode, so no programmatic creation of the nav controller is done. The nav controller is presented modally in fullscreen, so the rest of the app is run atop the login view, with this nav controller as the centerpiece of everything.The navigation controller contains a view (with a view controller named UserStartPageVC), and in its navigation bar is a logout button. This button sends an target action to UserStartPageVC, with the goal of dismissing the nav controller thus bringing the user back to the login view.So far everything works fine. I can login and use the app as intended. But! When I log out and then re-login XCode tells me this: Warning! Attempt to present &lt;MainNavigationVC: 0x753110&gt; on &lt;LoginVC: 0x756fcf0&gt; while a presentation is in progress!I suppose this means that the login view is trying to modally display a MainNavigationVC navigation controller, but another one is already displayed, right? But how? Can a view be presented without showing? And how can I get rid of the old nav controller when logging out? I've tried several ways of dismissing the modal view, for instance:from within UserStartpageVC running[x dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:NULL][x dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES]where x is either self, self.parentViewController or self.presentingViewController.setting the LoginVC as a property in UserStartpageVC and running[self.loginVC dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:NULL]and so on.All of the tested calls actually brings me back to the login screen, so it's kind of working.Any ideas? Relevant code samples can be provided if necessary, I just couldn't figure out which pieces that were of interest. The seguing to the navigation controller has no code (except for a performSegueWithIdentifier:sender:), and the code for dismissing it is the part I cannot seem to get straight.As a sidenote. So far this isn't a REAL problem; the app runs, and it IS possible to logout and re-login without any other side-effects than an error message in XCode. But I suppose this will be a memory leak if users logout and login multiple times, and I'm not in the mood of an unnecessary rejection from Apple."

An int use 4 bytes and a boolean uses a byte (it doesn't have to but it does with OpenJDK/HotSpot) BitSet uses two objects and more memory for small sets, but only one bit per have. So for small collections an int[] can be smaller than a BitSet but as the size grows, BitSet will be the smallest.If the data structure is smaller than your cache the fastest is int[] then boolean[] then BitSet This is because there is non-trival overhead in breaking int into byte or a bit.However once your cache size becomes important, it can be that the overhead of BitSet fades compared to the overhead of using a slower cache or main memory.In short: if in doubt use BitSet as this is clearer as to your intent and its likely to be faster."

12597347	b"This is actually a lot more tricky than you might expect. For many reasons.The primary issue is that RGB space is a device dependent space - RGB values that look similar on one device need not look similar on another. (If you think this sounds unlikely - there is a huge history of issues between getting good color correspondence between mac / win / SGI due to the different assumptions made by the OS about monitor gamma.)The second issue is that the perception of difference between two colors depends heavily on the surrounding colors / viewing environment. I.e. two colors may look different when viewed in a dark surround in a dark environment, but similar in a white surround in a light environment.With these provisos in mind Delta CIE 94 is a decent measure of color similarity.You'll calculate it by converting each color from RGB to XYZ and then to Lab.The RGB to XYZ transformation is device dependent - there are some simple standard transformations floating about for it, such as sRGB, but their applicability to real devices is questionable. The transformation from XYZ to Lab is complicated and can be found here - for your reference whitepoint you'd use the white point of your device (or sRGB if you're using the standard).Finally you can use the formulae you have listed above to do the final transformations.Since this is all relatively painful, you may have better luck calling out to a proper color management tool like LCMS"

The way Java does it is that it defines a hashCode for every object and by default the hashCode for two objects are the same iff the two objects are the same in memory. So when the client of the hashtable overrides the equals() method for an object, he should also override the method that computes hashcode such that if a.equals(b) is true, then a.hashCode() must also equal b.hashCode(). This way, it is assured that equal objects have the same hashcode.'

I would advice you to stay with websql for now, I think phonegap will keep supporting it for a while.The problem with the spec was, that there isn't a standerd way to query. Every vendor used SQLite, but a spec can't be build on one product, that would be very dangerous. Also in most cases different db vendors mean different SQL dialects. This is also in contradiction with a standard way of working. This would mean you would have to check which db you are working and then use a different dialect. That is why they decided to use a uniform API called indexeddb.All browsers that use an database like SQL lite to store the data in only the interface to query is the indexeddb API, so in that way indexeddb is something like an odbc.

12602287	b'when you say this: Note: new attributes can be added at any timeThat carries a whole lot of consequences. SQL as originally developed, was not intended to support what I\'ll call a "dynamic data model". The discovery of a new but missing attribute in the data model was occasioned by only one of two events: a change in the information requirements or a discovery of an error or omission in the current implementation. Dynamic data modeling isn\'t necessarily a bad thing, but if you acheive it by throwing out a lot of the discipline that comes with classical database management, you throw out the corresponding guarantees at the same time.If you go one step further, and say that any user can add a new attribute as well as add new data, there are even more consequences. Two users may discover the same attribute, and give it different names. This results in the "synonym problem". Two users may discover two different attributes but give the same name to both. This results in the "homonym problem". If you leave these problems unresolved, making sense out of the resulting data is going to be nearly impossible.I\'m going to remind you of two differences that are important with regard to adding new attributes to an existing database. At the SQL level, it\'s the difference between DDL and DML. At the data level, it\'s the difference between metadata and data. You may know most of this, but it\'s worth reconsidering in the light of dynamic modeling. In a classical database, the way you implement a newly discovered attribute of an existing entity or relationship among entities, is by a construct like This is DDL. The right to perform DDL is typically limited to DBAs and not granted to users that provide data or use applications as an interface to provide data. So the model is not dynamic in that sense. And the DBA community (if there\'s more than one DBA) confers with each other before altering the model.When you do something like adding a column to an existing table, two things happen. First, the structure of the actual table is altered to accomodate the new column. Second, the data dictionary is updated to reflect the alteration of the table.The data diciotnary contains metadata, data that describes a model of the database itself. User tables contain data, which describes the subject matter. Generally, when you try to implement dynamic modeling in SQL, you end up storing copies of metadata (like column names) in user tables. It becomes your responsibility to maintain the correlation between this user data and the actual data structures, or their reflection in the data dictionary.You can do this. But it\'s a whole lot of work. And you are embarking on a journey where SQL may not be the best way to get where you\'re going.'

12602886	b'From your comment: I just can\'t see how this is achieved when you have to tell the subject which elements to trigger by selectors instead of the subject having a list that the observer can register toPlease correct me if I\'m wrong, but you seem to be misunderstanding how the pattern was implemented in jQuery. You don\'t "tell the subject which elements to trigger", and the subject doesn\'t have "a list that the observer can register to" either. It works like this:The subject/publisher emits/triggers certain events (on certain circumstances you define).The observer/subscriber listens to certain events. It keeps a list of the events it subscribed to.That\'s all based on DOM events, so it\'s limited by the DOM Event Model.For example, consider the following HTML:Let\'s make the inner divs trigger a custom event called \'custom\'. You define when that should happen, on this example this will happen when they are clicked:Now let\'s make the document element subscribe to that custom event:When the custom event is triggered by one of the divs, the observer/subscriber is notified and a message is logged to the console.The example uses document as the observer for a reason: events bubble up the DOM tree, and can only be caught by elements that are ancestors of the one that triggered it. Since document is the root of the DOM tree, it can see all events. If #div1 was our observer, it would only see events triggered by #div1 itself, but not the ones triggered by #div2. Maybe that limitation is what confused you?There are ways to circumvent that limitation, but usually, if you want to do something to #div1 based upon an event triggered by #div2, you just do it from the callback you have setup on the document element (or the closest common ancestor to both divs). Anyway, it seems you really want an alternative, so here is one in the form of a jQuery plugin:You can use it like this:Live example: '

It should only copy the fields you want to use for indexing (the meta-data). Sample code to do this (without the subroutines or functions it calls) from my Copy Incident to Main agent:Then, you need to add code into the onLoad event of the index form in the index database. I put mine in an agent called by a ToolsRunMacro, but you could put it in directly. This is my Open Project Copy agent.Now, you could limit the index database to only documents for the most recent year or see how it works when all documents are in it. A lot really depends on how much data you need to have available in views.In my situation, the index database contains index documents for documents from many databases and serves as a central access point for the "full data" databases.

12605636	b'Basically, to run through the list as fast as possible, you have a few things to avoid;Lock collisions. Even with spin locks, every loop iteration is a missed opportunity to get work done.Memory barriers. Every time you do an atomic operation, a memory barrier will halt your execution.Unnecessary work, such as scanning the list for work to do.I\'ll have to agree with your reading and take the side of spin locks.You put the pointer to the head of the list in a volatile pointer. Each thread then in turn;Takes the spin lockSaves the value of the pointer in a temporaryUpdates the pointer to the next list entry Releases the spinlock.It can then commence working on the entry pointed to by the temporary.This has some advantages to seeking through the list using a per-entry lock;If the work per item takes non trivial time to complete, you\'ll have very few collisions for the short duration of updating the pointer.Barring a collision, you\'ll only have 2 memory barriers for each list item, one for lock, one for unlock.No scanning of the list to get a new work item, just get the work from the "queue".'

If you call startActivity it will actually create a new activity 1 on the navigation stack, which will be completely independent of the original activity 1 and all of its data.EDIT:Sorry, I had not noticed this before but make sure you do not call finish() in your first activity when you are starting the second. If you do, it will close the activity completely and you will lose all data you had in it (including the savedInstanceState).

12609039	b"I know this isn't the answer that you want.The idea of unit testing is to make sure your logic is correct. Unit tests catch bugs where incorrect logic has been written. If a method contains no logic (that is, no branching, looping or exception handling), then it is uneconomical to unit test it. By that, I mean that a unit test costs money - time to write it, and time to maintain it. Most unit tests pay us back for that investment, either by finding bugs, or re-assuring us that there are no bugs in the domain of what is being tested.But a unit test for your getBufferedReader method would not pay you back for our investment. It has a finite cost, but zero benefit, because there is no actual logic that can go wrong. Therefore, you should NOT write such a unit test. If your Cobertura settings or your organisational standards require the existence of such a unit test, then those settings or standards are WRONG and should be changed. Otherwise, your employer's money is being spent on something that has an infinite cost:benefit ratio. I strongly recommend that your standards are changed so that you only write unit test for methods that contain branching, looping or exception handling."

12612600	b"Numeric isn't a primitive type so you can't do arithmetic operations on it directly. C doesn't have operator overloading, so there's no way to add a multiply operator for Numeric. You'll have to use appropriate function calls to multiply numerics.As with most things when writing Pg extension functions it can be helpful to read the source and see how it's done elsewhere.In this case look at src/backend/utils/adt/numeric.c. Examine Datum numeric_mul(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS) where you'll see it use mul_var(...) to do the work.Unfortunately mul_var is static so it can't be used outside numeric.c. Irritating and surprising. There must be a reasonable way to handle NUMERIC from C extension functions without using the spi/fmgr to do the work via SQL operator calls, as you've shown in your comment where you use DirectFunctionCall2 to invoke the numeric_mul operator.It looks like the public stuff for Numeric that's callable directly from C is in src/include/utils/numeric.h so let's look there. Whoops, not much, just some macros for converting between Numeric and Datum and some helper GETARG and RETURN macros. Looks like usage via the SQL calls might be the only way.If you do find yourself stuck using DirectFunctionCall2 via the SQL interfaces for Numeric, you can create a Numeric argument for the other side from a C integer using int4_numeric.If you can't find a solution, post on the pgsql-general mailing list, you'll get more people experienced with C extensions and the source code there.

12613697	b"So the current solution I have found is as follows...So to begin with, I have the path of tile coordinates for the character saved in an ivar array for example...So as you can see this has some points which would require so form of diagonal movement. I then call the pathfind method and this iterates over the requestedPositionQueue and adds all the intermediate tile coordinates ensuring it always picks a tile either vertically or horizontally but never diagonally next to the current tile until it completes the entire path.Then in the update: method I iterate over the requestedPositionArray, taking the next tile coordinate from it, convert it to a pixel position then assign that to my requestedPosition ivar and then run the movePlayer: method (code in the original post).I have put comments in the pathfind method for my own benefit and thus may not be that comprehensive but they may help your understanding of my thinking.Finally this is the best I have come up with which allows me to ensure I can either move my character to a pixel position without restrictions or if I want move them there but confine them to only moving vertically or horizontally via tile centres. So if you can see a way to refine and optimise this code please do, or any constructive criticism will always be appreciated.

Note that there is no rejection step here; the distributions themselves have dealt with the necessary bias towards zero. Since the normal distribution and a semi-circle are not the same shape, I wonder if RBarryYoung's answer really gives a uniform distribution on the surface of the sphere or not.Regarding uniform hypercube picking with hypersphere rejection (RBarryYoung's answer)The Mathworld article includes a description of using 4 random numbers picked from uniform distributions to calculate random vectors on the surface of a 3d sphere. It performs rejection on the 4d vector of random numbers of anything outside the unit hypersphere, as RBarryYoung does, but it differs in that it (a)uses an extra random number and (b)performs a non-linear transform on the numbers to extract the 3d unit vector.To me, that implies that uniform distributions on each axis with hypersphere rejection will not achieve a uniform distribution over the surface of the sphere."

What i was expecting from the replacement of the line was a fully listed out set of spring beans that composed all of the AOP pointcuts, advice/aspects, etc. that make up the caching support, but it seems like this is al\xc3\xa5l just statically created classes with tight coupling between each other."

12668164	b' I\'d like to figure out what causes it, or at the very least write a smaller reproduction to send into Microsoft, but I have no idea where to even begin."Smaller reproduction" definitely sounds like a great idea here... even if "smaller" won\'t mean "quicker to reproduce".Before you even start, try to reproduce the error on another machine. If you can\'t reproduce it on another machine, that suggests a whole different set of tests to do - hardware, installation etc.Also, check you\'re on the latest version of everything. It would be annoying to spend days debugging this (which is likely, I\'m afraid) and then end up with a response of "Yes, we know about this - it was a bug in .NET 4 which was fixed in .NET 4.5" for example. If you can reproduce it on a variety of framework versions, that would be even better :)Next, cut out everything you can in the program:Does it have a user interface at all? If possible, remove that.Does it use a database? See if you can remove all database access: definitely any output which isn\'t used later, and ideally input too. If you can hard code the input within the app, that would be ideal - but if not, files are simpler for reproductions than database access.Is it data-sensitive? Again, without knowing much about the app it\'s hard to know whether this is useful, but assuming it\'s processing a lot of data, can you use a binary search to find a relatively small amount of data which causes the problem?Does it have to be multi-threaded? If you can remove all the threading, obviously that may well then take much longer to reproduce the problem - but does it still happen at all?Try removing bits of business logic: if your app is componentized appropriately, you can probably fake out whole significant components by first creating a stub implementation, and then simply removing the calls.All of this will gradually reduce the size of the app until it\'s more manageable. At each step, you\'ll need to run the app again until it either crashes or you\'re convinced it won\'t crash. If you have a lot of machines available to you, that should help...'

12679231	b"In answer to your question HERE.Well, you could pipe the output to sort, but there are at least three problems with that.The first problem is that when you just tack it to the end, it only sort's one line at a time. Meaning it doesn't sort at all. To fix that, you can put the entire for command inside a block () then pipe the output of the block to sort, which causes other problems, though I'm confident that it's possible to solve these issues.The second problem with that is that it sort's the date alphabetically, starting with the month. This means that all Januaries 1/dd/yyyy will come first, then all Octobers 10/dd/yyyy meaning that you get all the years mixed together, AND it's sorted January, October, November, December, Febuary, March, etc.You could sort by size by using sort's /+col command, but you'll be comparing size[tab]filename meaning 2[tab]hello comes AFTER 1000[tab]hello. (Type sort /?ENTER to learn more about sort.)What I reccomend is that use use dir's ability to sort like so:There are other options for the /o: order command.

12685442	b"There are a number of ways to go about implementing this. It really depends on what kinds of notifications you want to cover and what information you need to collect about the notification to show it to the right user(s). If you are looking for a simple design that just covers notifications about posted comments, you could use a combination of polymorphic associations and observer callbacks:What's happening here is that each photo, status, event etc. has many comments. A Comment obviously belongs to a :commenter but also to a :commentable, which is either a photo, status, event or any other model that you want to allow comments for. You then have a CommentObserver that will observe your Comment model and do something whenever something happens with the Comment table. In this case, after a Comment is created, the observer will create a CommentNotification with the id of the comment and the id of the user who owns the thing that the comment is about (comment.commentable.owner.id). This would require that you implement a simple method :owner for each model you want to have comments for. So, for example, if the commentable is a photo, the owner would be the user who posted the photo.This basic design should be enough to get you started, but note that if you want to create notifications for things other than comments, you could extend this design by using a polymorphic association in a more general Notification model.With this design, you would then 'observe' all your notifiables (models that you want to create notifications for) and do something like the following in your after_create callback:The only tricky part here is the user_to_notify method. All models that are notifiable would have to implement it in some way depending on what the model is. For example, wall_post.user_to_notify would just be the owner of the wall, or like.user_to_notify would be the owner of the thing that was 'liked'. You might even have multiple people to notify, like when notifying all the people tagged in a photo when someone comments on it.Hope this helps."

However, if you assign the bitmap to a drawable and then call bitmap.recycle(), and then try and use the drawable you'll get an exception because the drawable cannot access the recycled bitmap.I was writing a ListView similar to what you've got, and what I ended up doing was calling bitmap.recycle on any bitmap that was more than ten slots above the current viewport, setting a flag on that ListView item to show its bitmap had been recycled, and then getting getView to re-load the bitmap if the user scrolled back up there."

12700349	b"The fundamental issue I see with your code is that it is not layered. You are trying to do too much data manipulation in one routine. Your code for reading the ADC values in another post is layered and that is what you should be doing for this device.The AD9833 waveform generator is fundamentally a 16-bit device. Its three types of registers that you need to program are all 16 bits. It's only the data transfer (using SPI) that is 8 bits. So only the actual output statements (using spi()) need to deal with bytes (just like your ADC input routine immediately converts the bytes read into a short integer). The values calculated for the generator should be 16-bit values. Then you should be able to see how the code implements the data requirements in the generator's data sheet. This code allows specification of either FREQ0 or FREQ1 and either PHASE0 or PHASE1 registers. The source code for *WG_out()* looks complex, but it actually compiles down to very simple machine code.Code Improvements still neededMagic numbers need to be replaced with #defines.Instead of rewriting the complete Control register, a state variable needs to be maintained so that only Control bits are modified as needed.

12720796	b"There's a difference between network roaming and data roaming.Generally, network roaming is allowing your telco to go through third-party satellites while you're outside the country so you can stay connected to their services. Even if you already told your telco that you want to subscribe to network roaming, it will NOT be activated until you actually begin connecting via third-party telco satellites, and that only happens when you're actually out of the country.Data roaming is simply allowing/disallowing your device to consume mobile data while you are in network roaming mode. It's more device-dependent and you can easily turn it on or off in the phone's Settings app.In short, if you want to detect network roaming, use TelephonyManager.isNetworkRoaming(). If you want to check whether data roaming is turned on or off, use Settings.Secure.getInt(getContentResolver(), Settings.Secure.DATA_ROAMING).IMPORTANT: I haven't personally tested the following scenarios and I'm not sure what value isNetworkRoaming() will return.You didn't tell your home telco to turn network roaming on, but when you arrived at some other country, the phone began detecting other telco networks.After scenario 1, your phone asks you to choose which of the detected telco networks to connect to. You choose one and the phone attempts to connect. I don't know what value isNetworkRoaming() will return here because you didn't subscribe to network roaming in the first place."

Use AppDomain.ExecuteAssembly to call your current application.If instead of an application you have a class library you can try the following:Create a new class library project.Add the following interface to the new class library project:public interface IRemoteLoader{ void Load(); void Unload();}Add an implementation of this interface to your class library that needs to execute in a new AppDomain. In the Load, Unload methods you should add code to perform initialization and cleanup respectively. Make the class derive from MarchsalByRefObject. This is needed for .NET Remoting to create proxy objects on both AppDomains.After you create the new AppDomain, use CreateInstanceAndUnwrap to create an instance of the loader class from step 3.Use the Load, Unload on the object created from step 4.This will be enough if you do not fine-grained control and simply starting/stopping is enough."

13284033	b"Up until recently, I have only seen copying of structure fields done with memcpy(). In classes and online instructions, copying the contents of one struct into another generally looks likeHowever, this task can also be accomplished by a simple assignment replacing the memcpy().Is there good reason why this isn't as widely used (at least in my limited experience)? Are these two methods\xe2\x80\x94assignment and memcpy()\xe2\x80\x94equivalent, or is there some compelling reason to use memcpy() in general?"
13284089	b'Try this it will work:mention this id only in IE specific stylesheets. '
13284125	b"Both methods are equivalent, and perform a shallow copy. This means that the structure itself is copied, but anything the structure references is not copied.As for why memcpy is more popular, I'm not sure. Older versions of C did not support structure assignment (although it was a common extension as early as 1978), so perhaps the memcpy style stuck as a way of making more portable code? In any case, structure assignment is widely supported in PC compilers, and using memcpy is more error-prone (if you get the size wrong, Bad Things are likely to happen), and so it's best to use structure assignment where possible.There are, however, cases where only memcpy works. For example:If you're copying a structure to or from an unaligned buffer - eg, to save/load to/from disk or send/receive on a network - you need to use memcpy, as structure assignment requires both source and destination to be aligned properly.If you're packing additional information after a structure, perhaps using a zero-element array, you need to use memcpy, and factor this additional information into the size field.If you're copying an array of structures, it may be more efficient to do a single memcpy rather than looping and copying the structures individually. Then again, it may not. It's hard to say, memcpy implementations differ in their performance characteristics.Some embedded compilers might not support structure assignment. There's probably other more important things the compiler in question doesn't support as well, of course.Note also that although in C memcpy and structure assignment are usually equivalent, in C++ memcpy and structure assignment are not equivalent. In general C++ it's best to avoid memcpying structures, as structure assignment can, and often is, overloaded to do additional things such as deep copies or reference count management."
13284156	b"People working on embedded platform will prefer to use memcopy instead of direct assignment of structure .Mainly when you deal with embedded platform, some compiler doesn't support direct structure assignment, for that you need to use memcopy.if you are working on pc then there is no issue in either case, Both are valid.

Both of these workarounds can have potential unwanted side-effects in terms of child element positioning and z-index stacking. PIE could easily force one or the other itself, but:   One or the other may be more appropriate depending on the particular situation, so the CSS author needs to be able to control which one gets chosen.

That way irregular timings don't have too much effect (and I can call my method to update the camera position at any time without worrying about changing its movement speed).It takes some work to make this behave correctly, though. keyDown: and keyUp: have some obnoxious behaviours when it comes to game input.

It does not modify the contents of the original character array a. Note the pointers a and b are local to the function. Also, note that basic rule about arrays is:"Arrays are not assignable, You have to copy each element in array." The code you have is equivalent to: It does not change the contents of the original array, it merely points an pointer which was pointing to the array to some another array.Copying each element of one array to another array is the functionality that strcpy() provides.

13966972	b'The mouseenter event fires when the mouse enters the control. The click event fires when the mouse is clicked. They are two separate events which call two separate event handlers. If you click just as the mouse enters the element they will be called within a short timespan of one another but they are still two distinct events.It is also important that you differentiate between the mousein and the mouseover events. Mousein fires when the mouse physically enters an element, whereas mouseover fires continually while the mouse remains over an element. While you cannot trigger the click event per se, you can call the same function that is called by the click event handler.

There is almost nothing you can do with the Pair&lt;?&gt; you get (e.g. you cannot put any data into it), because you don't know the type parameter."

14013115	b'On the other hand, if you\'re talking about not trusting the admin to create repo names with the proper naming convention, you have several solutions and alternatives.(1) is it sufficient to warn him so he can log on to the server, remove the offending repo, and fix up the config again?If so, use a PRE_CREATE or POST_CREATE trigger (see triggers.html in the gitolite docs). Check argument 2, test it, and print a noisy message if needed.(2) if a warning is not sufficient, and you need to kill it outright, use a PRE_CREATE trigger, except it has to be in perl. Use src/lib/Gitolite/Triggers/AutoCreate.pm as a model, except you have to check $_[1] (the second argument).(3) are you also an admin, perhaps the "main" one? If so, see delegation (see deleg.html in the gitolite documentation). This will have more constraints though (like if he is allowed to add keys, he will simply add a new key with your name and thus bypass the restriction.'

14061361	b"What method is suitable to capture (detect) MRZ from a photo of a document? I'm thinking about cascade classifier (e.g. Viola-Jones), but it seems a bit weird to use it for this problem."
14061812	b"A better approach would be the use of projection profile methods. A projection profile method is based on the following idea:Create an array A with an entry for every row in your b/w input document. Now set A[i] to the number of black pixels in the i-th row of your original image.(You can also create a vertical projection profile by considering columns in the original image instead of rows.)Now the array A is the projected row/column histogram of your document and the problem of detecting MRZs can be approached by examining the valleys in the A histogram.This problem, however, is not completely solved, so there are many variations and improvements. Here's some additional documentation:Projection profiles in Google Scholar: Tesseract-ocr, a great open source OCR library: https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/"
